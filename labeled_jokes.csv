After a while the lizard says his mouth is 'dry', and that he's going to get a drink from the river. 


At the riverbank, the lizard is so stoned that he leans too far over and falls in. A Crocodile sees this and swims over to the stoned lizard, helping him to the side. 


He then asks the lizard, ""What's the matter with you?!"" The lizard explains to the crocodile that he was sitting in the tree, smoking a joint with the monkey and his mouth got dry, and that he was so wasted that, when he went to get a drink from the river, he fell in! 

The inquisitive crocodile says he has to check this out. He walks into the jungle and finds the tree where the monkey is sitting, finishing a joint.

13,The Devil sat at the gates of hell... (Story Joke),29,0.92,"He was busy chuckling as he watched a rerun of World War 1 on TV, when suddenly a man appeared in a burst of flames. The man was covered from head-to-toe in blood and scorch marks. 

The Devil looked at his paperwork and frowned. He didn’t seem to have a file for the man. 

“Epstein!” The Devil roared, turning to a figure in the distance, “Stop swinging on that rope and get my paperwork in order. This is the second time this week!”

“It doesn’t matter,” the man whispered, his eyes wide in shock, “It’s the end of the world. You wouldn’t believe what I’ve just witnessed.”

“The end of the world?” The Devil asked, looking confused, “That’s odd, God wasn’t planning Armageddon until next Tuesday. He must have brought it forward. How interesting!”

The Devil looked at the man with curiosity, “Well, why don’t you tell me what you remember before you died.”

The man sighed, 

“Well, it all started when I went to visit an old friend. He had just moved into a new place. It feels like a dream now it’s over. 

I was moving through the entrance to the complex when I heard it. A low gargling noise, and dragging footsteps. The sound was truly terrifying. 

I looked to my right. And that’s when I saw it.”

“Saw what?!” The Devil asked curiously. 
 
“A zombie.”

The Devil jumped with excitement, “Alright,” He called, turning to his minions, “Who bet zombies for the Apocalypse?”

The man continued, “He was moving towards me slowly, eyes bloodshot, mouth open. His arms were raised for my throat. He didn’t even look human anymore. 

I realised in that moment that it was kill or be killed. My mind clicked into gear. This is what all those years of planning for a zombie apocalypse had paid off for. 

I pulled my trusty sidearm from my pants and let fire. Headshot of course. It’s the only way. 

Well shit went crazy then. 

Bodies started coming out of everywhere. Doors flung open and zombies began dragging themselves out. Some were crawling on the floor, some with horrific sores on their faces, others with a missing limb or too. 

All of them had the same dead look in their eyes.

I can’t tell you how many I took out. I was like Rick Grimes on drugs. Do you like zombie shows?”

“Oh yes.” The Devil nodded, “We’ve got Netflix down here, but we use Heaven’s account. It’s a victimless crime really. Like treason”

The man continued, “I came across one human who had a zombie with both arms over her shoulders. I took them both out. You can’t doubt yourself in those situations.

An alarm sounded across the complex, and I realised that I was done. I knew it was time. I pulled out a grenade from my satchel.  You always need one for an emergency.  I pulled the pin, held it, and charged at the enemy.

Next thing I know, I’m here.”

“What a story!” the Devil exclaimed, shooing away Joseph Stalin who had come to listen. 

“But we have a problem.” The Devil continued. “Let me consult my ‘Grey Area’ compendium. I’m quite sure killing zombies falls into a grey area. You know, defending your life against the undead and all.”

The Devil pulled out a book from nowhere, and flicked through the pages,

“Hmmm....Karens.....Reposters...ah! Here we are. Yes....yes I’m afraid that there’s been a mistake in your processing.” The Devil said cheerfully, “You get to go to heaven!”

The man clapped in excitement.

“Let me just make a quick call,” The Devil said, pulling a phone out of nowhere, and dialling a number. 

“Hey Jesus my man. It’s your boy Devil again,” The Devil said, “I’ve got another person here that’s yours.”

An angry voice sounded on the other end of the phone. 

The Devil paused and then nodded, before hanging up the phone. 

“What’s the matter?” The man asked. 

“I need to call back in twenty minutes.” The Devil explained, “He’s got 50 people that just arrived from a retirement village.”",4,True,False,1

56,There was once a young Gladiator who could never win a single match..,170,0.8,"Every fight, he would quickly get an advantage over his opponent, then somehow find himself lacking the courage or stamina to follow through with a decisive blow. In that moment of hesitation, his opponents would recover and quickly turn the tables, leaving the young gladiator bloody, bruised and defeated.
  
  
On hearing his next battle would be a fight to the death, he wallowed around the *ludus* in despair. Finally, an older gladiator - a grizzled Scandinavian warrior - took pity on him. 
  
  
*""There is a song of great power - composed by the most renowned skálds of my homeland. Any warrior who chants this song shall find themselves able to do whatever it takes to claim victory.""*
  
  
The grizzled Scandinavian warrior's eyes glaze over for a moment, as if recalling the battles he had partook of in the past. Finally, he nodded, and grunted in approval to the young gladiator.
  
  
*""Yea, I shall teach it to ye.""*
  
  
The next day, having learnt the song, the young gladiator marched into the arena for his death-match. To his dismay, his opponent was a giant - a corpulent, grotesquely-muscled ogre of a man nearly twice his size.
  
  
*""HA HA, PUNY SOD,""* sneered the giant, as he brandished his weapon - a massive spiked club the size of a horse's leg, the business end caked with dried blood and faeces. 
  
  
The hulking brute charged, and the battle began.
  
  
As expected, his opponent was mighty but ponderous, each blow from the massive spiked club slamming into the arena floor, missing the young gladiator by inches. 
  
  
As expected, the young gladiator was able to bob and weave around his opponent, landing jab after jab until finally a strike to the solar plexus left the goliath stumbling about the arena winded. 
  
  
And also as expected, it was at this moment when the young gladiator felt his momentum ebb and the adrenaline drain from his body, as he gazed upon the giant of an opponent he could not hope to defeat.

Dark thoughts of his opponent recovering, then taunting him before taking him down and pummelling his face into a bloody unrecognizable mess before doing unspeakable acts to him with the spiked club haunted the young gladiator's mind, refusing to leave. Then he remembered the song.
  
  
Here goes nothing, he thought, and started chanting.
  
  
No sooner had the words of the first verse left his lips that the young gladiator's eyes glazed over. He stood up straight - a strange and terrible calmness taking hold of him as he chanted verse after verse, stanza after stanza.
  
  
Then he swaggered up to his opponent and kicked him square in the crotch.
  
  
The goliath let out a high-pitched squeal unbecoming of a man of his stature, and fell to his knees, clutching at the bloody mess between his loins. Naturally, this would mean he had to let go of his massive spiked club, so it fell to the ground. Its handle had barely touched the arena floor before the young gladiator grabbed it, and with one smooth, graceful motion, slammed it into the giant's bulging belly, shattering both of the giant's arms at the same time.
  
  
The giant's squealing quickly became gurgles, as gouts of blood and the half digested remains of his meal spewed forth from his mouth. With a countenance void of all emotion, the young gladiator swung the spiked club again and again, his chanting barely audible over each sickening squelch and his opponent's anguished gurgling cries.
  
  
Finally, the giant fell face down, right in front of the sizable puddle of blood, viscera and half-digested food he had vomited up. As the giant struggled to get to his feet, the young gladiator kneeled on his back, then forced his face into the puddle, not releasing his grip until the thrashing became feeble twitching and finally the giant stopped moving.
  
  
The young gladiator stood atop the now-motionless body of his fallen opponent. Once again, he picked up the heavy spiked club, this time holding it over his head as though it weighed no heavier than a twig. His chanting rose to a guttural crescendo, before abruptly ending. He then smashed the spiked club into the giant's head, spraying blood, bone and brain matter all over the arena and over half of the audience.
  
  
The crowd stared in shocked silence for a moment, then one man stood up and started clapping. A second man cheered, then a third, and before long, thunderous applause filled the arena. The applause snapped the young gladiator out of his trance and he stared dumbfounded at the blood and gore before him.
  
  
Once the celebrations were over, the gladiator ran straight back to the *ludus*. Immediately, he sought the grizzled Scandinavian warrior and told him all that had transpired.

267,"A man walks into a bar, and sees a huge jar sitting on the counter.",329,0.95,"The jar is stuffed with $10 bills. There has to be at least twenty grand in there. Curious, he approaches the bartender.

He asks, ""What's the deal with the jar?""

The bartender replies, ""You put ten bucks in, and if you complete three challenges, you win the entire jar.""

""What are the challenges?""

""The money first.""

The man's feeling game, so he fishes a ten-dollar bill out of his pocket and stuffs it into the jar. ""Tell me,"" he says.

""Okay,"" the bartender says. ""First, you gotta drink a whole bottle of tequila in sixty seconds or less, without pulling a face or puking.

""Second, there's a large and angry pit bull chained up out the back. It has a bad tooth. You have to pull that tooth out with your bare hands.

""Third, there's a 90-year-old lady upstairs who's never had sex in her life. You have to go up there and nail her.""

The man is stunned. ""You'd have to be crazy to attempt all of that.""

""It's up to you,"" the bartender says, ""but your money stays in the jar.""

Well, the night goes on and the man has a few drinks, and he keeps looking over at the jar, until finally he gets back up says, "" I'll do it! Hand me that tequila!""

The bartender hands the man a bottle of tequila, which he unscrews and chugs down in under a minute without making a face. He throws the empty bottle to the ground and charges drunkenly out the back door, where he sees the chained-up pit bull.

From inside the bar, the bartender hears growling and barking and snarling and screaming, and then silence.

The man staggers back inside. His clothes are ripped to shreds and covered in blood, and all over him are cuts and scratches and bite-marks.

268,Old Butch,433,0.96," 

John was in the fertilized egg business. He had several hundred young laying hens, called 'pullets,' and ten roosters to fertilize the eggs.

Any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced. This took a lot of time, so he bought some tiny bells and attached them to his roosters.

Each bell had a different tone, so he could tell just from listening, which rooster was never performing. John could sit on the porch and log a performance report by just listening to the bells.

John's favorite rooster was old Butch, a very fine specimen, but one morning he noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! When he went to investigate, he saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing. 

To John's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring. Butch had learned to not chase the pullets, instead he would just quietly walk up on a pullet, do his job and walk on.

John was so proud of old Butch, he entered him in the Saint Lawrence County Fair and he became an overnight sensation with the judges. The judges not only awarded old Butch the ""No-Bell Piece-Prize,"" they also awarded him the ""Pulletsurprise"" as well.",9,False,False,1

303,The Devil sat at the gates of hell... (Story Joke),15968,0.92,"An old man suddenly arrived in a burst of flames, looking confused and lost. The Devil looked at his paperwork, and frowned. He was unable to find this old man’s data file. 

“This can’t be right,” the old man grumbled, looking at the Devil, “I’ve been a good man my whole life.”

The Devil nodded apologetically, most people said this when they arrived at Hell. 
“Why don’t you start with how you died and we’ll figure it out.” He said

The old man sighed and said:

“Well, I was out with minding my grandchildren, enjoying a fun day out. I don’t get the grandchildren often because my eyesight is starting to fade. But we were having the most wonderful time.. 

And that’s when everything went crazy! 

Out of nowhere, I spotted the largest most grotesque mouse I’ve ever seen moving towards us. It was absolutely enormous! 

And that’s when it moved. Straight towards the grandchildren first, limbs outstretched. You don’t know where mice have been, what if it had’ve bitten one of them? Can you imagine if they got rabies on my watch?”

“So what did you do?” The Devil whispered, entranced by the story. He was munching on a box of popcorn. 

The old man continued,

“You don’t get how big this mouse was! Radiation it must’ve been. Too many phones these days, that’s what causes it. 

I did the only think I could!

I grabbed my walking stick and I cracked it over the head. Now my eye sight isn’t that good anymore, but I whacked it good!

The kids started screaming at this point. You know how they get when you have to kill an animal. 

But I needed to keep going. You see with mice, you need to see their guts to know they’re dead. Otherwise they’ll be back with others.”

“So you killed it?” The Devil asked. Some of his demigods had come to listen to the story. 

The old man nodded,

“By golly I did! Guts and all were splattered for all to see. The kids had lost their mind at this point. Tears everywhere. A crowd had gathered as well, all screaming at the sight. 

It was at this point though, that the exertion caught up with me. I felt my heart give way. I must have suffered a heart attack. Next thing I know, I’m here.”

“Well,” the Devil said, concerned, “This doesn’t seem to add up. Let me just give Heaven a call and we’ll try and see what’s going on here. 

The Devil pulled up a phone from thin air and dialled a number. 

“Hey Jesus bro,” the Devil said, “I think I’ve got one of yours here. His story checks out. Must have been a mix up.”

The Devil nodded as a voice on the phone spoke back to him. He gave the old man a silent celebratory thumbs up as the voice continued. 

The Devil covered the phone speaker with his hand, turned to the old man and said, 

“You’re all good, they just want to know where you were when you died.”

The old man nodded, 

“Oh that’s easy, I was at Disneyland.”

In addition, Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialization, where it monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Drunken Boys Night 2.5 and Saturday Football 5.0 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected.

I cannot seem to keep wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run some of my other favorite applications. I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall does not work on this program.

Can you please help me !!!???

Thanks,
A TROUBLED USER

------------------------------------------------------------

Dear TROUBLED USER,

This is a very common complaint, but is mostly due to a primary misconception. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 with the idea that Wife 1.0 is merely a UTILITIES & ENTERTAINMENT program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and designed by it's creator to run everything.

It is unlikely you would be able to purge Wife 1.0 and still convert back to Girlfriend 7.0. Hidden operating files within your system would cause Girlfriend 7.0 to emulate Wife 1.0 so nothing is gained. It is impossible to uninstall, delete, or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this.

Some have tried to install Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0 but end up with more problems than the original system. Look in your manual under ""Warnings- Alimony/Child support"". I recommend you keep Wife 1.0 and deal with the situation.

I suggest installing background application program C:YES DEAR to alleviate software augmentation. Having installed Wife 1.0 myself, I might also suggest you read the entire section regarding General Partnership Faults (GPFs). You must assume all responsibility for faults and problems that might occur, regardless of their cause. The best course of action will be to enter the command C:APOLOGIZE. In any case avoid excessive use of C:YES DEAR because ultimately you may have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the operating system will return to normal. The system will run smoothly as long as you take the blame for all the GPFs.

Wife 1.0 is a great program, but very high-maintenance. Consider buying additional software to improve the performance of Wife 1.0. I recommend Flowers 3.1 and Diamonds 2K. Do not, under any circumstances install Secretary with Short Skirt 3.3. This is not a supported application for Wife 1.0 and is likely to cause irreversible damage to the operating system.

King Kong seemed to be quite passive, so the explorer slowly reached out and shyly touched him. But as soon as he made contact with the gorilla’s fur, King Kong went berserk. He immediately rose to his feet, began beating his chest and roared mightily.

As the explorer ran for his life, King Kong set off in hot pursuit. Instinctively the explorer headed for the heart of the jungle, hoping that he might be able to hide from his manic pursuer, but wherever he tried to conceal himself, King Kong always managed to find him.

As night began to fall, the explorer prayed that he would be able to lose the gorilla in the darkness but no matter how fast he ran, the sound of King Kong’s pounding footsteps was just behind him.

For three long days and nights, the explorer ran through the island, with King Kong always close behind, occasionally letting out a menacing roar from his vast throat. Eventually the explorer reached the coast. There were no ships in sight for an easy escape, so he realized the only option was to dive into the sea and hope that King Kong couldn’t swim. But to his horror, the gorilla jumped in straight after him and demonstrated an excellent front crawl.

On and on they swam across the ocean, rarely separated by more than a few waves, until four months later the weary explorer arrived in Brazil. He scrambled ashore with as much energy as he could muster, only to see the mighty King Kong right behind him, still beating his chest ferociously and with steam billowing from his nostrils. Through the streets of Rio they stumbled, explorer and ape equally exhausted, until the explorer took a wrong turn and ended up down a dead end, his escape barred by a huge wall.

With nowhere left to run, he sank to his knees in despair and pleaded to King Kong: ""Do whatever you want with me. Kill me, eat me, do what you like, but make it quick. I can't run anymore!""

King Kong slowly stalked over to the cowering explorer, extended his giant paw, then gently touched the man and roared: ‘TAG, YOU'RE IT!""",3,False,False,1

So the only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."" Jerry was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for.

As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a fresh start and live a new life.

 He saw a men's clothing store and thought to himself a new suit would be the perfect thing to mark this new beginning. He entered the shop and told the salesman: ""I'd like a new suit.""

As Jerry admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked: ""How about a new shirt?"" Jerry thought for a moment and then agreed. The salesman eyed Jerry again. ""Let's see... 34 sleeve and 16-and-a-half neck?"" Once again, Jerry was surprised. ""That's right, how did you know?"" ""Like I said, I've been in the business 60 years!""

""Well, young fella, I've been in the business long enough to know these things!"" Jerry tried on the shoes and they were also a remarkable fit. 

Jerry walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked: ""So that only leaves the new underwear. How about it?"" Jerry thought for a second and agreed. The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said: ""Let's see... size 36."" Jerry laughed. ""Ah ha! I got you! I've worn size 32 since I was 18 years old."" The salesman shook his head. ""There's no way. I'm never wrong. You can't wear a size 32."" ""Oh yes I can,"" replied Jerry and have been most of my life. ""I don't understand,"" said the tailor.

Chapter 1

[1:1] In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,
[1:2] the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.
[1:3] Then God said, ""Let there be light""; and there was light.
[1:4] And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.
[1:5] God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
[1:6] And God said, ""Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.""
[1:7] So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so.
[1:8] God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
[1:9] And God said, ""Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear."" And it was so.
[1:10] God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
[1:11] Then God said, ""Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it."" And it was so.
[1:12] The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that it was good.
[1:13] And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
[1:14] And God said, ""Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years,
[1:15] and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth."" And it was so.
[1:16] God made the two great lights - the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night - and the stars.
[1:17] God set them in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth,
[1:18] to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
[1:19] And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
[1:20] And God said, ""Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky.""
[1:21] So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw that it was good.
[1:22] God blessed them, saying, ""Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.""
[1:23] And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
[1:24] And God said, ""Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind."" And it was so.
[1:25] God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good.
[1:26] Then God said, ""Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.""
[1:27] So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.
[1:28] God blessed them, and God said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.""
[1:29] God said, ""See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.
[1:30] And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food."" And it was so.
[1:31] God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

Chapter 2

[2:1] Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude.
[2:2] And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done.
[2:3] So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation.
[2:4] These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created. In the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
[2:5] when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up - for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the ground;
[2:6] but a stream would rise from the earth, and water the whole face of the ground -
[2:7] then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.
[2:8] And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
[2:9] Out of the ground the LORD God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[2:10] A river flows out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divides and becomes four branches.
[2:11] The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
[2:12] and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
[2:13] The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Cush.
[2:14] The name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
[2:15] The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it.
[2:16] And the LORD God commanded the man, ""You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;
[2:17] but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.""
[2:18] Then the LORD God said, ""It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner.""
[2:19] So out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
[2:20] The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper as his partner.
[2:21] So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
[2:22] And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
[2:23] Then the man said, ""This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this one shall be called Woman, for out of Man this one was taken.""
[2:24] Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh.
[2:25] And the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed.

Chapter 3

[3:1] Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, ""Did God say, 'You shall not eat from any tree in the garden'?""
[3:2] The woman said to the serpent, ""We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden;
[3:3] but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die. '""
[3:4] But the serpent said to the woman, ""You will not die;
[3:5] for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.""
[3:6] So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate.
[3:7] Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.
[3:8] They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
[3:9] But the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, ""Where are you?""
[3:10] He said, ""I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.""
[3:11] He said, ""Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?""
[3:12] The man said, ""The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate.""
[3:13] Then the LORD God said to the woman, ""What is this that you have done?"" The woman said, ""The serpent tricked me, and I ate.""
[3:14] The LORD God said to the serpent, ""Because you have done this, cursed are you among all animals and among all wild creatures; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[3:15] I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will strike your head, and you will strike his heel.""
[3:16] To the woman he said, ""I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.""
[3:17] And to the man he said, ""Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life;
[3:18] thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
[3:19] By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return.""
[3:20] The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
[3:21] And the LORD God made garments of skins for the man and for his wife, and clothed them.
[3:22] Then the LORD God said, ""See, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever""--
[3:23] therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
[3:24] He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a sword flaming and turning to guard the way to the tree of life.

Chapter 4

[4:1] Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, ""I have produced a man with the help of the LORD.""
[4:2] Next she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.
[4:3] In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground,
[4:4] and Abel for his part brought of the firstlings of his flock, their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,
[4:5] but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
[4:6] The LORD said to Cain, ""Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?
[4:7] If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.""
[4:8] Cain said to his brother Abel, ""Let us go out to the field."" And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.
[4:9] Then the LORD said to Cain, ""Where is your brother Abel?"" He said, ""I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?""
[4:10] And the LORD said, ""What have you done? Listen; your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground!
[4:11] And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
[4:12] When you till the ground, it will no longer yield to you its strength; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.""
[4:13] Cain said to the LORD, ""My punishment is greater than I can bear!
[4:14] Today you have driven me away from the soil, and I shall be hidden from your face; I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and anyone who meets me may kill me.""
[4:15] Then the LORD said to him, ""Not so! Whoever kills Cain will suffer a sevenfold vengeance."" And the LORD put a mark on Cain, so that no one who came upon him would kill him.
[4:16] Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
[4:17] Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and named it Enoch after his son Enoch.
[4:18] To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methushael, and Methushael the father of Lamech.
[4:19] Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
[4:20] Adah bore Jabal; he was the ancestor of those who live in tents and have livestock.
[4:21] His brother's name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
[4:22] Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who made all kinds of bronze and iron tools. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
[4:23] Lamech said to his wives: ""Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.
[4:24] If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold.""
[4:25] Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, for she said, ""God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, because Cain killed him.""
[4:26] To Seth also a son was born, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to invoke the name of the LORD.

Chapter 5

[5:1] This is the list of the descendants of Adam. When God created humankind, he made them in the likeness of God.
[5:2] Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them ""Humankind"" when they were created.
[5:3] When Adam had lived one hundred thirty years, he became the father of a son in his likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth.
[5:4] The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years; and he had other sons and daughters.
[5:5] Thus all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years; and he died.
[5:6] When Seth had lived one hundred five years, he became the father of Enosh.
[5:7] Seth lived after the birth of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:8] Thus all the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years; and he died.
[5:9] When Enosh had lived ninety years, he became the father of Kenan.
[5:10] Enosh lived after the birth of Kenan eight hundred fifteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:11] Thus all the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years; and he died.
[5:12] When Kenan had lived seventy years, he became the father of Mahalalel.
[5:13] Kenan lived after the birth of Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:14] Thus all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
[5:15] When Mahalalel had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Jared.
[5:16] Mahalalel lived after the birth of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:17] Thus all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years; and he died.
[5:18] When Jared had lived one hundred sixty-two years he became the father of Enoch.
[5:19] Jared lived after the birth of Enoch eight hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:20] Thus all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years; and he died.
[5:21] When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Methuselah.
[5:22] Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:23] Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.
[5:24] Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him.
[5:25] When Methuselah had lived one hundred eighty-seven years, he became the father of Lamech.
[5:26] Methuselah lived after the birth of Lamech seven hundred eighty- two years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:27] Thus all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years; and he died.
[5:28] When Lamech had lived one hundred eighty-two years, he became the father of a son;
[5:29] he named him Noah, saying, ""Out of the ground that the LORD has cursed this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands.""
[5:30] Lamech lived after the birth of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:31] Thus all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years; and he died.
[5:32] After Noah was five hundred years old, Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

Chapter 6

[6:1] When people began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
[6:2] the sons of God saw that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose.
[6:3] Then the LORD said, ""My spirit shall not abide in mortals forever, for they are flesh; their days shall be one hundred twenty years.""
[6:4] The Nephilim were on the earth in those days - and also afterward - when the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.
[6:5] The LORD saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.
[6:6] And the LORD was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
[6:7] So the LORD said, ""I will blot out from the earth the human beings I have created - people together with animals and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.""
[6:8] But Noah found favor in the sight of the LORD.
[6:9] These are the descendants of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.
[6:10] And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
[6:11] Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.
[6:12] And God saw that the earth was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon the earth.
[6:13] And God said to Noah, ""I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; now I am going to destroy them along with the earth.
[6:14] Make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.
[6:15] This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
[6:16] Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above; and put the door of the ark in its side; make it with lower, second, and third decks.
[6:17] For my part, I am going to bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.
[6:18] But I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
[6:19] And of every living thing, of all flesh, you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.
[6:20] Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every kind shall come in to you, to keep them alive.
[6:21] Also take with you every kind of food that is eaten, and store it up; and it shall serve as food for you and for them.""
[6:22] Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.

Chapter 7

[7:1] Then the LORD said to Noah, ""Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you alone are righteous before me in this generation.
[7:2] Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and its mate; and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and its mate;
[7:3] and seven pairs of the birds of the air also, male and female, to keep their kind alive on the face of all the earth.
[7:4] For in seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.""
[7:5] And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.
[7:6] Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.
[7:7] And Noah with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
[7:8] Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,
[7:9] two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.
[7:10] And after seven days the waters of the flood came on the earth.
[7:11] In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
[7:12] The rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
[7:13] On the very same day Noah with his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons entered the ark,
[7:14] they and every wild animal of every kind, and all domestic animals of every kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every bird of every kind - every bird, every winged creature.
[7:15] They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.
[7:16] And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in.
[7:17] The flood continued forty days on the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.
[7:18] The waters swelled and increased greatly on the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the waters.
[7:19] The waters swelled so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered;
[7:20] the waters swelled above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.
[7:21] And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, domestic animals, wild animals, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all human beings;
[7:22] everything on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
[7:23] He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, human beings and animals and creeping things and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.
[7:24] And the waters swelled on the earth for one hundred fifty days.

Chapter 8

[8:1] But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and all the domestic animals that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided;
[8:2] the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,
[8:3] and the waters gradually receded from the earth. At the end of one hundred fifty days the waters had abated;
[8:4] and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
[8:5] The waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.
[8:6] At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made
[8:7] and sent out the raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.
[8:8] Then he sent out the dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground;
[8:9] but the dove found no place to set its foot, and it returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took it and brought it into the ark with him.
[8:10] He waited another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark;
[8:11] and the dove came back to him in the evening, and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.
[8:12] Then he waited another seven days, and sent out the dove; and it did not return to him any more.
[8:13] In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and saw that the face of the ground was drying.
[8:14] In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
[8:15] Then God said to Noah,
[8:16] ""Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
[8:17] Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh - birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth - so that they may abound on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.""
[8:18] So Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives.
[8:19] And every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out of the ark by families.
[8:20] Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
[8:21] And when the LORD smelled the pleasing odor, the LORD said in his heart, ""I will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.
[8:22] As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.""

Chapter 9

[9:1] God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.
[9:2] The fear and dread of you shall rest on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the air, on everything that creeps on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered.
[9:3] Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and just as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.
[9:4] Only, you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.
[9:5] For your own lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning: from every animal I will require it and from human beings, each one for the blood of another, I will require a reckoning for human life.
[9:6] Whoever sheds the blood of a human, by a human shall that person's blood be shed; for in his own image God made humankind.
[9:7] And you, be fruitful and multiply, abound on the earth and multiply in it.""
[9:8] Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,
[9:9] ""As for me, I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants after you,
[9:10] and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the domestic animals, and every animal of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark.
[9:11] I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.""
[9:12] God said, ""This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:
[9:13] I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
[9:14] When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,
[9:15] I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
[9:16] When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.""
[9:17] God said to Noah, ""This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.""
[9:18] The sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.
[9:19] These three were the sons of Noah; and from these the whole earth was peopled.
[9:20] Noah, a man of the soil, was the first to plant a vineyard.
[9:21] He drank some of the wine and became drunk, and he lay uncovered in his tent.
[9:22] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.
[9:23] Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father's nakedness.
[9:24] When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him,
[9:25] he said, ""Cursed be Canaan; lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers.""
[9:26] He also said, ""Blessed by the LORD my God be Shem; and let Canaan be his slave.
[9:27] May God make space for Japheth, and let him live in the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be his slave.""
[9:28] After the flood Noah lived three hundred fifty years.
[9:29] All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years; and he died.

After a short time he acquires a cart to transport several dozen boxes of tomatoes, only to have to trade it in again so that he can buy a pickup truck to support his expanding business. By the end of the second year, he is the owner of a fleet of pickup trucks and manages a staff of a hundred former unemployed people, all selling tomatoes.

I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I'd forgotten to make. I found the number and dialled it. A man answered, saying, ""Hello.""

I politely said, ""This is David. Could I please speak with Robert Campbell?""

Suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear, ""Get the right f**king number!"" and the phone was slammed down on me. I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude!

When I tracked down Robert's correct number to call him, I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits.

After hanging up with him, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again.

When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, ""You're a c**t!"" and hung up.

I wrote his number down with the word 'C**t' next to it and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I'd call him up and yell, ""You're a c**t!"" It always cheered me up.

When Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic ""C**t"" calling would have to stop. So, I called his number and said, ""Hi, this is John Smith from BT. I'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?""

He yelled, ""NO!"" and slammed down the phone. I quickly called him back and said, ""That's because you're a c**t!""

One day I was at Lakeside Shopping Centre, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. Some guy in a gunmetal grey Land Rover cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. I noticed a ""For Sale"" sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number.

A couple of days later, right after calling the first c**t (I had his number on speed dial), I thought that I'd better call the Land Rover C**t, too.

I said, ""Is this the man with the gunmetal grey Land Rover for sale?"" ""Yes, it is"", he said.

""Can you tell me where I can see it?"" I asked.

""Yes, I live at 129 Alice Street. It's a terraced house and the car's parked right out in front.""

""What's your name?"" I asked.

""My name is Steve Hansen,"" he said.

""When's a good time to catch you, Steve?""

""I'm home most days as I'm currently unemployed.""

""Listen, Steve, can I tell you something?""

""Yes?""

""Steve, you're a c**t!""

Then I hung up and added his number to my speed dial, too.

Now, when I had a problem, I had two arseholes to call. Then one day I came up with an idea. I called C**t #1.

""Hello?""

""You're a C**t!"" (But I didn't hang up.) ""Are you still there?"" he asked.

""Yeah,"" I said.

""STOP F**KING CALLING ME!"" he screamed.

""Make me,"" I said.

""Who are you?"" he asked.

""My name is Steve Hansen.""

""Yeah? Where do you live?""

""I live at 129 Alice Street , Ilford, a terraced house, with my gunmetal grey Land Rover parked out the front.""

He said, ""I'm coming over right now, Steve. And you had better start saying your prayers.""

I said, ""Yeah, like I'm really scared, C**t,"" and hung up.

Then I called C**t #2.

""Hello?"" he said.

""Hello, C**t,"" I said.

He yelled, ""If I ever find out who you are...""

""You'll do what?"" I said.

""I'll kick your arse,"" he exclaimed.

""Well, C**t, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now.""

Then I hung up and immediately called the Police, saying that I lived at 129 Alice Street, Ilford and that I was on my way over there to kill my cheating boyfriend.

Then I called Channel 5 News about the hoodie war going down right now in Alice Street, Ilford.

The first alien then went to a cricket stadium where the World Cup was talking place. Sachin, the batsman, hit the winning sixer and exclaimed - ""I DID IT!"", so the alien learnt to say ""I DID IT!"".

11,The Devil sat at the gates of hell... (Story Joke),29,0.92,"He was busy chuckling as he watched a rerun of World War 1 on TV, when suddenly a man appeared in a burst of flames. The man was covered from head-to-toe in blood and scorch marks. 

The Devil looked at his paperwork and frowned. He didn’t seem to have a file for the man. 

“Epstein!” The Devil roared, turning to a figure in the distance, “Stop swinging on that rope and get my paperwork in order. This is the second time this week!”

“It doesn’t matter,” the man whispered, his eyes wide in shock, “It’s the end of the world. You wouldn’t believe what I’ve just witnessed.”

“The end of the world?” The Devil asked, looking confused, “That’s odd, God wasn’t planning Armageddon until next Tuesday. He must have brought it forward. How interesting!”

The Devil looked at the man with curiosity, “Well, why don’t you tell me what you remember before you died.”

The man sighed, 

“Well, it all started when I went to visit an old friend. He had just moved into a new place. It feels like a dream now it’s over. 

I was moving through the entrance to the complex when I heard it. A low gargling noise, and dragging footsteps. The sound was truly terrifying. 

I looked to my right. And that’s when I saw it.”

“Saw what?!” The Devil asked curiously. 
 
“A zombie.”

The Devil jumped with excitement, “Alright,” He called, turning to his minions, “Who bet zombies for the Apocalypse?”

The man continued, “He was moving towards me slowly, eyes bloodshot, mouth open. His arms were raised for my throat. He didn’t even look human anymore. 

I realised in that moment that it was kill or be killed. My mind clicked into gear. This is what all those years of planning for a zombie apocalypse had paid off for. 

I pulled my trusty sidearm from my pants and let fire. Headshot of course. It’s the only way. 

Well shit went crazy then. 

Bodies started coming out of everywhere. Doors flung open and zombies began dragging themselves out. Some were crawling on the floor, some with horrific sores on their faces, others with a missing limb or too. 

All of them had the same dead look in their eyes.

I can’t tell you how many I took out. I was like Rick Grimes on drugs. Do you like zombie shows?”

“Oh yes.” The Devil nodded, “We’ve got Netflix down here, but we use Heaven’s account. It’s a victimless crime really. Like treason”

The man continued, “I came across one human who had a zombie with both arms over her shoulders. I took them both out. You can’t doubt yourself in those situations.

An alarm sounded across the complex, and I realised that I was done. I knew it was time. I pulled out a grenade from my satchel.  You always need one for an emergency.  I pulled the pin, held it, and charged at the enemy.

Next thing I know, I’m here.”

“What a story!” the Devil exclaimed, shooing away Joseph Stalin who had come to listen. 

“But we have a problem.” The Devil continued. “Let me consult my ‘Grey Area’ compendium. I’m quite sure killing zombies falls into a grey area. You know, defending your life against the undead and all.”

The Devil pulled out a book from nowhere, and flicked through the pages,

“Hmmm....Karens.....Reposters...ah! Here we are. Yes....yes I’m afraid that there’s been a mistake in your processing.” The Devil said cheerfully, “You get to go to heaven!”

The man clapped in excitement.

“Let me just make a quick call,” The Devil said, pulling a phone out of nowhere, and dialling a number. 

“Hey Jesus my man. It’s your boy Devil again,” The Devil said, “I’ve got another person here that’s yours.”

An angry voice sounded on the other end of the phone. 

The Devil paused and then nodded, before hanging up the phone. 

“What’s the matter?” The man asked. 

“I need to call back in twenty minutes.” The Devil explained, “He’s got 50 people that just arrived from a retirement village.”",4,True,False,1

173,There was once a young Gladiator who could never win a single match..,167,0.8,"Every fight, he would quickly get an advantage over his opponent, then somehow find himself lacking the courage or stamina to follow through with a decisive blow. In that moment of hesitation, his opponents would recover and quickly turn the tables, leaving the young gladiator bloody, bruised and defeated.
  
  
On hearing his next battle would be a fight to the death, he wallowed around the *ludus* in despair. Finally, an older gladiator - a grizzled Scandinavian warrior - took pity on him. 
  
  
*""There is a song of great power - composed by the most renowned skálds of my homeland. Any warrior who chants this song shall find themselves able to do whatever it takes to claim victory.""*
  
  
The grizzled Scandinavian warrior's eyes glaze over for a moment, as if recalling the battles he had partook of in the past. Finally, he nodded, and grunted in approval to the young gladiator.
  
  
*""Yea, I shall teach it to ye.""*
  
  
The next day, having learnt the song, the young gladiator marched into the arena for his death-match. To his dismay, his opponent was a giant - a corpulent, grotesquely-muscled ogre of a man nearly twice his size.
  
  
*""HA HA, PUNY SOD,""* sneered the giant, as he brandished his weapon - a massive spiked club the size of a horse's leg, the business end caked with dried blood and faeces. 
  
  
The hulking brute charged, and the battle began.
  
  
As expected, his opponent was mighty but ponderous, each blow from the massive spiked club slamming into the arena floor, missing the young gladiator by inches. 
  
  
As expected, the young gladiator was able to bob and weave around his opponent, landing jab after jab until finally a strike to the solar plexus left the goliath stumbling about the arena winded. 
  
  
And also as expected, it was at this moment when the young gladiator felt his momentum ebb and the adrenaline drain from his body, as he gazed upon the giant of an opponent he could not hope to defeat.

Dark thoughts of his opponent recovering, then taunting him before taking him down and pummelling his face into a bloody unrecognizable mess before doing unspeakable acts to him with the spiked club haunted the young gladiator's mind, refusing to leave. Then he remembered the song.
  
  
Here goes nothing, he thought, and started chanting.
  
  
No sooner had the words of the first verse left his lips that the young gladiator's eyes glazed over. He stood up straight - a strange and terrible calmness taking hold of him as he chanted verse after verse, stanza after stanza.
  
  
Then he swaggered up to his opponent and kicked him square in the crotch.
  
  
The goliath let out a high-pitched squeal unbecoming of a man of his stature, and fell to his knees, clutching at the bloody mess between his loins. Naturally, this would mean he had to let go of his massive spiked club, so it fell to the ground. Its handle had barely touched the arena floor before the young gladiator grabbed it, and with one smooth, graceful motion, slammed it into the giant's bulging belly, shattering both of the giant's arms at the same time.
  
  
The giant's squealing quickly became gurgles, as gouts of blood and the half digested remains of his meal spewed forth from his mouth. With a countenance void of all emotion, the young gladiator swung the spiked club again and again, his chanting barely audible over each sickening squelch and his opponent's anguished gurgling cries.
  
  
Finally, the giant fell face down, right in front of the sizable puddle of blood, viscera and half-digested food he had vomited up. As the giant struggled to get to his feet, the young gladiator kneeled on his back, then forced his face into the puddle, not releasing his grip until the thrashing became feeble twitching and finally the giant stopped moving.
  
  
The young gladiator stood atop the now-motionless body of his fallen opponent. Once again, he picked up the heavy spiked club, this time holding it over his head as though it weighed no heavier than a twig. His chanting rose to a guttural crescendo, before abruptly ending. He then smashed the spiked club into the giant's head, spraying blood, bone and brain matter all over the arena and over half of the audience.
  
  
The crowd stared in shocked silence for a moment, then one man stood up and started clapping. A second man cheered, then a third, and before long, thunderous applause filled the arena. The applause snapped the young gladiator out of his trance and he stared dumbfounded at the blood and gore before him.
  
  
Once the celebrations were over, the gladiator ran straight back to the *ludus*. Immediately, he sought the grizzled Scandinavian warrior and told him all that had transpired.
  
  
This song you taught me, the young gladiator enquired. What was the nature of this song, that it would banish all cowardice and drive one to such violence and savagery?
  
  
The grizzled Scandinavian warrior burst into uproarious laughter. He laughed and laughed and laughed for over a minute. Finally, he stopped laughing and stared straight at the young gladiator. With bloodlust bouncing about in his eyes and a shit-eating grin slowly creeping across his face, he replied:

* X mark - USD 1.00
* Knowing where to put it - USD 4,999.00",9,False,False,1

400,"Dear Tech Support,",42,0.8,"Last year I upgraded from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 and noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of new space and valuable resources. No mention of this phenomenon was included in the product brochure.

In addition, Wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialization, where it monitors all other system activity. Applications such as Poker Night 10.3, Drunken Boys Night 2.5 and Saturday Football 5.0 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected.

I cannot seem to keep wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run some of my other favorite applications. I am thinking about going back to Girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall does not work on this program.

Can you please help me !!!???

Thanks,
A TROUBLED USER

------------------------------------------------------------

Dear TROUBLED USER,

This is a very common complaint, but is mostly due to a primary misconception. Many people upgrade from Girlfriend 7.0 to Wife 1.0 with the idea that Wife 1.0 is merely a UTILITIES & ENTERTAINMENT program. Wife 1.0 is an OPERATING SYSTEM and designed by it's creator to run everything.

It is unlikely you would be able to purge Wife 1.0 and still convert back to Girlfriend 7.0. Hidden operating files within your system would cause Girlfriend 7.0 to emulate Wife 1.0 so nothing is gained. It is impossible to uninstall, delete, or purge the program files from the system once installed. You cannot go back to Girlfriend 7.0 because Wife 1.0 is not designed to do this.

Some have tried to install Girlfriend 8.0 or Wife 2.0 but end up with more problems than the original system. Look in your manual under ""Warnings- Alimony/Child support"". I recommend you keep Wife 1.0 and deal with the situation.

I suggest installing background application program C:YES DEAR to alleviate software augmentation. Having installed Wife 1.0 myself, I might also suggest you read the entire section regarding General Partnership Faults (GPFs). You must assume all responsibility for faults and problems that might occur, regardless of their cause. The best course of action will be to enter the command C:APOLOGIZE. In any case avoid excessive use of C:YES DEAR because ultimately you may have to give the APOLOGIZE command before the operating system will return to normal. The system will run smoothly as long as you take the blame for all the GPFs.

Wife 1.0 is a great program, but very high-maintenance. Consider buying additional software to improve the performance of Wife 1.0. I recommend Flowers 3.1 and Diamonds 2K. Do not, under any circumstances install Secretary with Short Skirt 3.3. This is not a supported application for Wife 1.0 and is likely to cause irreversible damage to the operating system.

Best of Luck,

401,Old Butch,432,0.96," 

John was in the fertilized egg business. He had several hundred young laying hens, called 'pullets,' and ten roosters to fertilize the eggs.

Any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced. This took a lot of time, so he bought some tiny bells and attached them to his roosters.

Each bell had a different tone, so he could tell just from listening, which rooster was never performing. John could sit on the porch and log a performance report by just listening to the bells.

John's favorite rooster was old Butch, a very fine specimen, but one morning he noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! When he went to investigate, he saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing. 

To John's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring. Butch had learned to not chase the pullets, instead he would just quietly walk up on a pullet, do his job and walk on.

Chapter 1

[1:1] In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,
[1:2] the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.
[1:3] Then God said, ""Let there be light""; and there was light.
[1:4] And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.
[1:5] God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.
[1:6] And God said, ""Let there be a dome in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.""
[1:7] So God made the dome and separated the waters that were under the dome from the waters that were above the dome. And it was so.
[1:8] God called the dome Sky. And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
[1:9] And God said, ""Let the waters under the sky be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear."" And it was so.
[1:10] God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
[1:11] Then God said, ""Let the earth put forth vegetation: plants yielding seed, and fruit trees of every kind on earth that bear fruit with the seed in it."" And it was so.
[1:12] The earth brought forth vegetation: plants yielding seed of every kind, and trees of every kind bearing fruit with the seed in it. And God saw that it was good.
[1:13] And there was evening and there was morning, the third day.
[1:14] And God said, ""Let there be lights in the dome of the sky to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years,
[1:15] and let them be lights in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth."" And it was so.
[1:16] God made the two great lights - the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night - and the stars.
[1:17] God set them in the dome of the sky to give light upon the earth,
[1:18] to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
[1:19] And there was evening and there was morning, the fourth day.
[1:20] And God said, ""Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the dome of the sky.""
[1:21] So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, of every kind, with which the waters swarm, and every winged bird of every kind. And God saw that it was good.
[1:22] God blessed them, saying, ""Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.""
[1:23] And there was evening and there was morning, the fifth day.
[1:24] And God said, ""Let the earth bring forth living creatures of every kind: cattle and creeping things and wild animals of the earth of every kind."" And it was so.
[1:25] God made the wild animals of the earth of every kind, and the cattle of every kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground of every kind. And God saw that it was good.
[1:26] Then God said, ""Let us make humankind in our image, according to our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth.""
[1:27] So God created humankind in his image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.
[1:28] God blessed them, and God said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.""
[1:29] God said, ""See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.
[1:30] And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food."" And it was so.
[1:31] God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

Chapter 2

[2:1] Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all their multitude.
[2:2] And on the seventh day God finished the work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done.
[2:3] So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all the work that he had done in creation.
[2:4] These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created. In the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
[2:5] when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up - for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no one to till the ground;
[2:6] but a stream would rise from the earth, and water the whole face of the ground -
[2:7] then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being.
[2:8] And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
[2:9] Out of the ground the LORD God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[2:10] A river flows out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it divides and becomes four branches.
[2:11] The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
[2:12] and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
[2:13] The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one that flows around the whole land of Cush.
[2:14] The name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
[2:15] The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it.
[2:16] And the LORD God commanded the man, ""You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;
[2:17] but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die.""
[2:18] Then the LORD God said, ""It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper as his partner.""
[2:19] So out of the ground the LORD God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.
[2:20] The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper as his partner.
[2:21] So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh.
[2:22] And the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.
[2:23] Then the man said, ""This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; this one shall be called Woman, for out of Man this one was taken.""
[2:24] Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife, and they become one flesh.
[2:25] And the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed.

Chapter 3

[3:1] Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, ""Did God say, 'You shall not eat from any tree in the garden'?""
[3:2] The woman said to the serpent, ""We may eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden;
[3:3] but God said, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, nor shall you touch it, or you shall die. '""
[3:4] But the serpent said to the woman, ""You will not die;
[3:5] for God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.""
[3:6] So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate.
[3:7] Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.
[3:8] They heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.
[3:9] But the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, ""Where are you?""
[3:10] He said, ""I heard the sound of you in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.""
[3:11] He said, ""Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?""
[3:12] The man said, ""The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate.""
[3:13] Then the LORD God said to the woman, ""What is this that you have done?"" The woman said, ""The serpent tricked me, and I ate.""
[3:14] The LORD God said to the serpent, ""Because you have done this, cursed are you among all animals and among all wild creatures; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.
[3:15] I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will strike your head, and you will strike his heel.""
[3:16] To the woman he said, ""I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.""
[3:17] And to the man he said, ""Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life;
[3:18] thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.
[3:19] By the sweat of your face you shall eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return.""
[3:20] The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all living.
[3:21] And the LORD God made garments of skins for the man and for his wife, and clothed them.
[3:22] Then the LORD God said, ""See, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live forever""--
[3:23] therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.
[3:24] He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a sword flaming and turning to guard the way to the tree of life.

Chapter 4

[4:1] Now the man knew his wife Eve, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, ""I have produced a man with the help of the LORD.""
[4:2] Next she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.
[4:3] In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground,
[4:4] and Abel for his part brought of the firstlings of his flock, their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,
[4:5] but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.
[4:6] The LORD said to Cain, ""Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?
[4:7] If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is lurking at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.""
[4:8] Cain said to his brother Abel, ""Let us go out to the field."" And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.
[4:9] Then the LORD said to Cain, ""Where is your brother Abel?"" He said, ""I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?""
[4:10] And the LORD said, ""What have you done? Listen; your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground!
[4:11] And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.
[4:12] When you till the ground, it will no longer yield to you its strength; you will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.""
[4:13] Cain said to the LORD, ""My punishment is greater than I can bear!
[4:14] Today you have driven me away from the soil, and I shall be hidden from your face; I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and anyone who meets me may kill me.""
[4:15] Then the LORD said to him, ""Not so! Whoever kills Cain will suffer a sevenfold vengeance."" And the LORD put a mark on Cain, so that no one who came upon him would kill him.
[4:16] Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD, and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
[4:17] Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and named it Enoch after his son Enoch.
[4:18] To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael the father of Methushael, and Methushael the father of Lamech.
[4:19] Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
[4:20] Adah bore Jabal; he was the ancestor of those who live in tents and have livestock.
[4:21] His brother's name was Jubal; he was the ancestor of all those who play the lyre and pipe.
[4:22] Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who made all kinds of bronze and iron tools. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.
[4:23] Lamech said to his wives: ""Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, listen to what I say: I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.
[4:24] If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold.""
[4:25] Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and named him Seth, for she said, ""God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, because Cain killed him.""
[4:26] To Seth also a son was born, and he named him Enosh. At that time people began to invoke the name of the LORD.

Chapter 5

[5:1] This is the list of the descendants of Adam. When God created humankind, he made them in the likeness of God.
[5:2] Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them ""Humankind"" when they were created.
[5:3] When Adam had lived one hundred thirty years, he became the father of a son in his likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth.
[5:4] The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years; and he had other sons and daughters.
[5:5] Thus all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years; and he died.
[5:6] When Seth had lived one hundred five years, he became the father of Enosh.
[5:7] Seth lived after the birth of Enosh eight hundred seven years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:8] Thus all the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years; and he died.
[5:9] When Enosh had lived ninety years, he became the father of Kenan.
[5:10] Enosh lived after the birth of Kenan eight hundred fifteen years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:11] Thus all the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years; and he died.
[5:12] When Kenan had lived seventy years, he became the father of Mahalalel.
[5:13] Kenan lived after the birth of Mahalalel eight hundred and forty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:14] Thus all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.
[5:15] When Mahalalel had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Jared.
[5:16] Mahalalel lived after the birth of Jared eight hundred thirty years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:17] Thus all the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years; and he died.
[5:18] When Jared had lived one hundred sixty-two years he became the father of Enoch.
[5:19] Jared lived after the birth of Enoch eight hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:20] Thus all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years; and he died.
[5:21] When Enoch had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Methuselah.
[5:22] Enoch walked with God after the birth of Methuselah three hundred years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:23] Thus all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.
[5:24] Enoch walked with God; then he was no more, because God took him.
[5:25] When Methuselah had lived one hundred eighty-seven years, he became the father of Lamech.
[5:26] Methuselah lived after the birth of Lamech seven hundred eighty- two years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:27] Thus all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years; and he died.
[5:28] When Lamech had lived one hundred eighty-two years, he became the father of a son;
[5:29] he named him Noah, saying, ""Out of the ground that the LORD has cursed this one shall bring us relief from our work and from the toil of our hands.""
[5:30] Lamech lived after the birth of Noah five hundred ninety-five years, and had other sons and daughters.
[5:31] Thus all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years; and he died.
[5:32] After Noah was five hundred years old, Noah became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

Chapter 6

[6:1] When people began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them,
[6:2] the sons of God saw that they were fair; and they took wives for themselves of all that they chose.
[6:3] Then the LORD said, ""My spirit shall not abide in mortals forever, for they are flesh; their days shall be one hundred twenty years.""
[6:4] The Nephilim were on the earth in those days - and also afterward - when the sons of God went in to the daughters of humans, who bore children to them. These were the heroes that were of old, warriors of renown.
[6:5] The LORD saw that the wickedness of humankind was great in the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts was only evil continually.
[6:6] And the LORD was sorry that he had made humankind on the earth, and it grieved him to his heart.
[6:7] So the LORD said, ""I will blot out from the earth the human beings I have created - people together with animals and creeping things and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.""
[6:8] But Noah found favor in the sight of the LORD.
[6:9] These are the descendants of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.
[6:10] And Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
[6:11] Now the earth was corrupt in God's sight, and the earth was filled with violence.
[6:12] And God saw that the earth was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted its ways upon the earth.
[6:13] And God said to Noah, ""I have determined to make an end of all flesh, for the earth is filled with violence because of them; now I am going to destroy them along with the earth.
[6:14] Make yourself an ark of cypress wood; make rooms in the ark, and cover it inside and out with pitch.
[6:15] This is how you are to make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.
[6:16] Make a roof for the ark, and finish it to a cubit above; and put the door of the ark in its side; make it with lower, second, and third decks.
[6:17] For my part, I am going to bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.
[6:18] But I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you.
[6:19] And of every living thing, of all flesh, you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.
[6:20] Of the birds according to their kinds, and of the animals according to their kinds, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind, two of every kind shall come in to you, to keep them alive.
[6:21] Also take with you every kind of food that is eaten, and store it up; and it shall serve as food for you and for them.""
[6:22] Noah did this; he did all that God commanded him.

Chapter 7

[7:1] Then the LORD said to Noah, ""Go into the ark, you and all your household, for I have seen that you alone are righteous before me in this generation.
[7:2] Take with you seven pairs of all clean animals, the male and its mate; and a pair of the animals that are not clean, the male and its mate;
[7:3] and seven pairs of the birds of the air also, male and female, to keep their kind alive on the face of all the earth.
[7:4] For in seven days I will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights; and every living thing that I have made I will blot out from the face of the ground.""
[7:5] And Noah did all that the LORD had commanded him.
[7:6] Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came on the earth.
[7:7] And Noah with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives went into the ark to escape the waters of the flood.
[7:8] Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground,
[7:9] two and two, male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.
[7:10] And after seven days the waters of the flood came on the earth.
[7:11] In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
[7:12] The rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.
[7:13] On the very same day Noah with his sons, Shem and Ham and Japheth, and Noah's wife and the three wives of his sons entered the ark,
[7:14] they and every wild animal of every kind, and all domestic animals of every kind, and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every bird of every kind - every bird, every winged creature.
[7:15] They went into the ark with Noah, two and two of all flesh in which there was the breath of life.
[7:16] And those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the LORD shut him in.
[7:17] The flood continued forty days on the earth; and the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.
[7:18] The waters swelled and increased greatly on the earth; and the ark floated on the face of the waters.
[7:19] The waters swelled so mightily on the earth that all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered;
[7:20] the waters swelled above the mountains, covering them fifteen cubits deep.
[7:21] And all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, domestic animals, wild animals, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all human beings;
[7:22] everything on dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.
[7:23] He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, human beings and animals and creeping things and birds of the air; they were blotted out from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.
[7:24] And the waters swelled on the earth for one hundred fifty days.

Chapter 8

[8:1] But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and all the domestic animals that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind blow over the earth, and the waters subsided;
[8:2] the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, the rain from the heavens was restrained,
[8:3] and the waters gradually receded from the earth. At the end of one hundred fifty days the waters had abated;
[8:4] and in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat.
[8:5] The waters continued to abate until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared.
[8:6] At the end of forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made
[8:7] and sent out the raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.
[8:8] Then he sent out the dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground;
[8:9] but the dove found no place to set its foot, and it returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took it and brought it into the ark with him.
[8:10] He waited another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark;
[8:11] and the dove came back to him in the evening, and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth.
[8:12] Then he waited another seven days, and sent out the dove; and it did not return to him any more.
[8:13] In the six hundred first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and saw that the face of the ground was drying.
[8:14] In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.
[8:15] Then God said to Noah,
[8:16] ""Go out of the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons' wives with you.
[8:17] Bring out with you every living thing that is with you of all flesh - birds and animals and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth - so that they may abound on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.""
[8:18] So Noah went out with his sons and his wife and his sons' wives.
[8:19] And every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, everything that moves on the earth, went out of the ark by families.
[8:20] Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
[8:21] And when the LORD smelled the pleasing odor, the LORD said in his heart, ""I will never again curse the ground because of humankind, for the inclination of the human heart is evil from youth; nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done.
[8:22] As long as the earth endures, seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night, shall not cease.""

Chapter 9

[9:1] God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, ""Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth.
[9:2] The fear and dread of you shall rest on every animal of the earth, and on every bird of the air, on everything that creeps on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea; into your hand they are delivered.
[9:3] Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; and just as I gave you the green plants, I give you everything.
[9:4] Only, you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.
[9:5] For your own lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning: from every animal I will require it and from human beings, each one for the blood of another, I will require a reckoning for human life.
[9:6] Whoever sheds the blood of a human, by a human shall that person's blood be shed; for in his own image God made humankind.
[9:7] And you, be fruitful and multiply, abound on the earth and multiply in it.""
[9:8] Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him,
[9:9] ""As for me, I am establishing my covenant with you and your descendants after you,
[9:10] and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the domestic animals, and every animal of the earth with you, as many as came out of the ark.
[9:11] I establish my covenant with you, that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.""
[9:12] God said, ""This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations:
[9:13] I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth.
[9:14] When I bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds,
[9:15] I will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh.
[9:16] When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.""
[9:17] God said to Noah, ""This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.""
[9:18] The sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan.
[9:19] These three were the sons of Noah; and from these the whole earth was peopled.
[9:20] Noah, a man of the soil, was the first to plant a vineyard.
[9:21] He drank some of the wine and became drunk, and he lay uncovered in his tent.
[9:22] And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brothers outside.
[9:23] Then Shem and Japheth took a garment, laid it on both their shoulders, and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father's nakedness.
[9:24] When Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his youngest son had done to him,
[9:25] he said, ""Cursed be Canaan; lowest of slaves shall he be to his brothers.""
[9:26] He also said, ""Blessed by the LORD my God be Shem; and let Canaan be his slave.
[9:27] May God make space for Japheth, and let him live in the tents of Shem; and let Canaan be his slave.""
[9:28] After the flood Noah lived three hundred fifty years.
[9:29] All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years; and he died.

418,"An explorer spent weeks scouring the jungles of Skull Island, hoping to see the legendary King Kong. One day, when he was all but certain that it was nothing but a myth, he came to a clearing - and right there before him, sitting pensively, was the imposing figure of King Kong...",19,0.86,"The explorer glared at King Kong in awe, and approached him slowly. King Kong seemed to be quite passive, so the explorer slowly reached out and shyly touched him. But as soon as he made contact with the gorilla’s fur, King Kong went berserk. He immediately rose to his feet, began beating his chest and roared mightily.

As the explorer ran for his life, King Kong set off in hot pursuit. Instinctively the explorer headed for the heart of the jungle, hoping that he might be able to hide from his manic pursuer, but wherever he tried to conceal himself, King Kong always managed to find him.

As night began to fall, the explorer prayed that he would be able to lose the gorilla in the darkness but no matter how fast he ran, the sound of King Kong’s pounding footsteps was just behind him.

For three long days and nights, the explorer ran through the island, with King Kong always close behind, occasionally letting out a menacing roar from his vast throat. Eventually the explorer reached the coast. There were no ships in sight for an easy escape, so he realized the only option was to dive into the sea and hope that King Kong couldn’t swim. But to his horror, the gorilla jumped in straight after him and demonstrated an excellent front crawl.

On and on they swam across the ocean, rarely separated by more than a few waves, until four months later the weary explorer arrived in Brazil. He scrambled ashore with as much energy as he could muster, only to see the mighty King Kong right behind him, still beating his chest ferociously and with steam billowing from his nostrils. Through the streets of Rio they stumbled, explorer and ape equally exhausted, until the explorer took a wrong turn and ended up down a dead end, his escape barred by a huge wall.

With nowhere left to run, he sank to his knees in despair and pleaded to King Kong: ""Do whatever you want with me. Kill me, eat me, do what you like, but make it quick. I can't run anymore!""

King Kong slowly stalked over to the cowering explorer, extended his giant paw, then gently touched the man and roared: ‘TAG, YOU'RE IT!""",3,False,False,1

Taken aback, the man protests that he has neither a computer nor an e-mail address. To this the Microsoft manager replies, ""Well then, that means that you virtually don't exist and can therefore hardly expect to be employed."" 

Stunned, the man leaves. Not knowing where to turn and having only $10 in his wallet, he decides to buy a 25 LB flat of tomatoes at the supermarket. Within 2 hours, he sells all the tomatoes individually at 100% profit. He repeats the process several more times that day and ends up with $150 before going to sleep that night. 

And then it dawns on him that he could quite easily make a living selling tomatoes. Getting up early every day and going to bed late, he multiplies his profits quickly.  After a short time he acquires a cart to transport several dozen boxes of tomatoes, only to have to trade it in again so that he can buy a pickup truck to support his expanding business. By the end of the second year, he is the owner of a fleet of pickup trucks and manages a staff of a hundred former unemployed people, all selling tomatoes. 

Planning for the future of his wife and children, he decides to buy some life insurance. Consulting with an insurance adviser, he picks an insurance plan to fit his new circumstances. At the end of the telephone conversation, the adviser asks him for his e-mail address in order to send the final documents electronically. 

When the man replies that he has no e-mail, the adviser is stunned, ""What! You don't have e-mail? How on earth have you managed to amass such wealth without the Internet, e-mail and e-commerce?

About midnight he got real horny and decided to take a poke at the first hole. It was good but not really satisfying so he took a poke at the second hole. It was even better but he still wasn't satisfied so he thought about the third hole and reasoned to himself, ""If that first hole was pretty good and the second hole was even better, I'll bet that third hole will really do the trick!"" So he stuck his dick in the hole and felt the most intense pain and no matter what he did he couldn't get his dick out. The farmer came in the next morning and found him half dead and still stuck in the third hole. ""I told you and you didn't listen! What is wrong with you!"" ""Well,"" the salesman replied. ""I should have listened to you. I got horny last night and tried that first hole and it was pretty fair but not really satisfying so I tried the second hole. It was good but didn't do the job so I took on that third hole.  What's behind the holes oh god!"" ""I don't owe you an answer, but I'll tell you anyway. The first hole was my wife.

That did not deter them however. They chose to accept their differences in style preferences and keep playing music together. Soon enough their music had become such a great hit that they were going on world tours. 

On one such concert, somewhere in Japan, during the last encore a giant, aquatic monster rose from the sea's surface. With anger it begun rampaging around and spreading death and havoc. 

The band, in a attempt to make the best out of such a situation and taking advantage of their prior experience as park wardens, quickly jumped from stage.

The bad news is that it will require castration."" ""You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine, and the pressure creates these serious headaches you've been experiencing. So the only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."" Jerry was shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for. He couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but decided he had no choice but to go under the knife. 

When he eventually left the hospital Jerry was pleasantly surprised at how good it felt not to have a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he also knew that he was missing an important part of himself. As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a fresh start and live a new life.

 He saw a men's clothing store and thought to himself a new suit would be the perfect thing to mark this new beginning. He entered the shop and told the salesman: ""I'd like a new suit."" The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said: ""Let's see... size 44 long?"" ""That's right, how did you know?"" said Jerry, laughing. ""I've been in the business 60 years!"" replied the tailor. Jerry tried on the suit and it fit like a glove

As Jerry admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked: ""How about a new shirt?"" Jerry thought for a moment and then agreed. The salesman eyed Jerry again. ""Let's see... 34 sleeve and 16-and-a-half neck?"" Once again, Jerry was surprised. ""That's right, how did you know?"" ""Like I said, I've been in the business 60 years!"" So Jerry tried on the shirt, and it was a perfect fit. 

As Jerry adjusted the collar in the mirror, the salesman asked: ""How about new shoes?"" Jerry was on a roll and so thought, why not? So the salesman eyed Jerry's feet and said: ""Let's see... you must be a size nine-and-a-half?"" Jerry was astonished. ""That's right, how did you know?"" ""Well, young fella, I've been in the business long enough to know these things!"" Jerry tried on the shoes and they were also a remarkable fit. 

Jerry walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked: ""So that only leaves the new underwear. How about it?"" Jerry thought for a second and agreed. The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said: ""Let's see... size 36."" Jerry laughed. ""Ah ha! I got you! I've worn size 32 since I was 18 years old."" The salesman shook his head. ""There's no way. I'm never wrong. You can't wear a size 32."" ""Oh yes I can,"" replied Jerry and have been most of my life. ""I don't understand,"" said the tailor. ""By my reckoning a size 32 underwear would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell of a headache.",12,False,False,1

“This can’t be right,” the old man grumbled, looking at the Devil, “I’ve been a good man my whole life.”

The Devil nodded apologetically, most people said this when they arrived at Hell. 
“Why don’t you start with how you died and we’ll figure it out.” He said

The old man sighed and said:

“Well, I was out with minding my grandchildren, enjoying a fun day out. I don’t get the grandchildren often because my eyesight is starting to fade. But we were having the most wonderful time.. 

And that’s when everything went crazy! 

Out of nowhere, I spotted the largest most grotesque mouse I’ve ever seen moving towards us. It was absolutely enormous! 

And that’s when it moved. Straight towards the grandchildren first, limbs outstretched. You don’t know where mice have been, what if it had’ve bitten one of them? Can you imagine if they got rabies on my watch?”

“So what did you do?” The Devil whispered, entranced by the story. He was munching on a box of popcorn. 

The old man continued,

“You don’t get how big this mouse was! Radiation it must’ve been. Too many phones these days, that’s what causes it. 

I did the only think I could!

I grabbed my walking stick and I cracked it over the head. Now my eye sight isn’t that good anymore, but I whacked it good!

The kids started screaming at this point. You know how they get when you have to kill an animal. 

But I needed to keep going. You see with mice, you need to see their guts to know they’re dead. Otherwise they’ll be back with others.”

“So you killed it?” The Devil asked. Some of his demigods had come to listen to the story. 

The old man nodded,

“By golly I did! Guts and all were splattered for all to see. The kids had lost their mind at this point. Tears everywhere. A crowd had gathered as well, all screaming at the sight. 

It was at this point though, that the exertion caught up with me. I felt my heart give way. I must have suffered a heart attack. Next thing I know, I’m here.”

“You’re all good, they just want to know where you were when you died.”

In their alien language, the first alien told the other two that they would have to learn Earth's language to be able to get a new battery. So, they decided to look around and learn.

The first alien found an airport and proceeded to hijack a flight to India. Two hours (the alien flew the plane) later, they landed. The first alien then went to a cricket stadium where the World Cup was talking place. Sachin, the batsman, hit the winning sixer and exclaimed - ""I DID IT!"", so the alien learnt to say ""I DID IT!"".

Meanwhile, the second alien visited a nearby candy store. A kid with a lollipop had his dad at the store with him. Another kid suddenly snatched his lollipop. The first kid then punched the other kid in the stomach and snatched back the lollipop, and the dad noticed this. The second kid started to cry. Angrily, the dad asked- ""Why did you hit him?"". The kid replied- ""Because he took my lollipop"". So, the second alien learnt to say- ""Because he took my lollipop"".

The third alien went to a baseball stadium, where a player ran a home run and yelled- ""HOORAY!"". So, the third alien learnt to say- ""HOORAY!"".

Back where they crashed was the house of a mad scientist. He just mixed together two solutions, when, at that moment, the three aliens came back together. There was a loud bang and the fumes of the reaction made the scientist go unconscious. The bang had alerted a policeman, who came running and on seeing that the scientist was unconscious and thinking he was dead, shouted- ""WHO DID THIS?"".

The first alien replied- ""I DID IT!""

The second alien replied- ""Because he took my lollipop.""

I was sitting at my desk when I remembered a phone call I'd forgotten to make. I found the number and dialled it. A man answered, saying, ""Hello.""

I politely said, ""This is David. Could I please speak with Robert Campbell?""

Suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear, ""Get the right f**king number!"" and the phone was slammed down on me. I couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude!

When I tracked down Robert's correct number to call him, I found that I had accidentally transposed the last two digits.

After hanging up with him, I decided to call the 'wrong' number again.

When the same guy answered the phone, I yelled, ""You're a c**t!"" and hung up.

I wrote his number down with the word 'C**t' next to it and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills or had a really bad day, I'd call him up and yell, ""You're a c**t!"" It always cheered me up.

When Caller ID was introduced, I thought my therapeutic ""C**t"" calling would have to stop. So, I called his number and said, ""Hi, this is John Smith from BT. I'm calling to see if you're familiar with our Caller ID Program?""

He yelled, ""NO!"" and slammed down the phone. I quickly called him back and said, ""That's because you're a c**t!""

One day I was at Lakeside Shopping Centre, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. Some guy in a gunmetal grey Land Rover cut me off and pulled into the spot I had patiently waited for. I hit the horn and yelled that I'd been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. I noticed a ""For Sale"" sign in his back window, so I wrote down his number.

A couple of days later, right after calling the first c**t (I had his number on speed dial), I thought that I'd better call the Land Rover C**t, too.

I said, ""Is this the man with the gunmetal grey Land Rover for sale?"" ""Yes, it is"", he said.

""Can you tell me where I can see it?"" I asked.

""Yes, I live at 129 Alice Street. It's a terraced house and the car's parked right out in front.""

""What's your name?"" I asked.

""My name is Steve Hansen,"" he said.

""When's a good time to catch you, Steve?""

""I'm home most days as I'm currently unemployed.""

""Listen, Steve, can I tell you something?""

""Yes?""

""Steve, you're a c**t!""

Then I hung up and added his number to my speed dial, too.

Now, when I had a problem, I had two arseholes to call. Then one day I came up with an idea. I called C**t #1.

""Hello?""

""You're a C**t!"" (But I didn't hang up.) ""Are you still there?"" he asked.

""Yeah,"" I said.

""STOP F**KING CALLING ME!"" he screamed.

""Make me,"" I said.

""Who are you?"" he asked.

""My name is Steve Hansen.""

""Yeah? Where do you live?""

""I live at 129 Alice Street , Ilford, a terraced house, with my gunmetal grey Land Rover parked out the front.""

He said, ""I'm coming over right now, Steve. And you had better start saying your prayers.""

I said, ""Yeah, like I'm really scared, C**t,"" and hung up.

Then I called C**t #2.

""Hello?"" he said.

""Hello, C**t,"" I said.

He yelled, ""If I ever find out who you are...""

""You'll do what?"" I said.

""I'll kick your arse,"" he exclaimed.

""Well, C**t, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now.""

Then I hung up and immediately called the Police, saying that I lived at 129 Alice Street, Ilford and that I was on my way over there to kill my cheating boyfriend.

Then I called Channel 5 News about the hoodie war going down right now in Alice Street, Ilford.

I quickly got into my car and headed over to Alice Street. I got there just in time to watch two massive c**ts beating the crap out of each other in front of six police cars, an overhead Police Helicopter and a News crew.

Stopping them, he said, ""You kids are a lot of fun. I used to do the same thing when I was your age. Will you do me a favor? I'll give you each a dollar if you'll promise to come around every day and do your thing.”

The boys were more than happy and continued to bang the bins every day on their walk home.

They notice a stake in the ground on the side of the road with the letters “RE” on it. “Hmmm” they wonder, “what’s that about?”

They continue on, and they notice another. Then one more.

At this point, the passenger merely sighs out of boredom, and then passes out, exhausted.

Meanwhile, the driver continues on. He starts seeing the signs with increasing frequency - RE, RE, RE, RE...

As it is quite late, he starts becoming a bit delirious and begins to imagine a crazy cat screeching with every sign he passes - “RE! RE! RE! RE!” The image is so strong in his mind that he can see the cat’s face and body - and hear crystal clear the screech in his head: “RE! RE! RE! RE!”

At this point, he finds this image to be so hilarious that he can no longer contain himself and begins crazily laughing and swerving the car.

All this commotion wakes up the passenger who exclaims “what in the world is going on?!”

Coming back to his senses, and realizing he could never articulate the crazy story to his friend, the driver says:

The man replies, ""No, absolutely not, what do you mean?"". She says: ""Oh, you must be new here. I'll explain it to you. It's one of the rules here that if you get an erection, it's assumed you called me.""
Smiling, she takes him to the side of the pool, lays down on her towel, pulls him over and lets him indulge his passions on her. 

The man continues his exploration and arrives at a sauna. When he sits down, he suddenly has to pass gas and within a few minutes a huge, rather revolting, hairy man emerges. “You called me?"", he asks. ""No, what do you mean,"" says the newcomer. “Oh, you must be new here, the man says. ""It's one of the rules here that if you fart, it is assumed you called me."" He grabs the man, turns him around and begins to act out all his fantasies with the newcomer.. 

The newcomer eventually waddles back to the office of the nudist camp, where he is greeted by a smiling, naked receptionist. ""Can I help you, sir?"", she asks politely.

Do you want to fuck us?” One male parrot looks over at the other male parrot and screams, ""put the bible away you idiot, our prayers have been answered!""

78,My favorite joke: Everyone Knows Dave,54885,0.96,"Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

His boss looks up and says, ""It was the final straw... you and the Pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'Who the fuck is that on the balcony with Dave?'",1134,False,False,1

84,"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.",54419,0.92,"His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... 

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""

Here's the joke I told:

""What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.""

One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

Amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop.
He follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and
trot across the road to a bus-stop.
The dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench.

The butcher follows, dumbstruck.

So he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window,
jumps off, and waits at the front door.

88,A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,53979,0.84,"So, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  When he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  He thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

A few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  He glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  Anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  He thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

The next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  He opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  The mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, ding-dong.  Ding-dong, Ding-dong.*

The door opens and standing there is a stout Buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“Pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“Ah, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“But that is my intention, dear man,” replies the Buddhist monk.  “You see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”

predictable and never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I
decided I needed a girl with some excitement.
When I was 28, I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her. She
rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad
impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun
initially and very energetic, but directionless. So I decided to find a girl
with some real ambition.
When I turned 30, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly

took everything I owned.

Three explorers get lost in a huge jungle. After wandering around for days, they are found and captured by a jungle tribe. The tribesmen take the explorers to their leader and drop them at his feet. The chieftain looks at them for a moment and says, “ The three of you will die unless you manage to do a near impossible task. Each of you must gather 10 fruits of the same kind and bring them to me.”
The explorers cannot believe their luck at being given such an easy task. They set out their separate ways to find a fruit as fast as they can. The first one finds an apple tree and so quickly gathers 10 of them. The second one finds some cherries and plucks a bunch of them.They rush to the chieftain and present the fruits. The chieftain smiles and says, “ Now you must shove them up your ass one by one, and if you make any noise or facial expression I will slit your throat right here.”
The first explorer,resigned to his fate, puts on a brave face and starts shoving the apples. He gets to four and then he can’t take it anymore. As soon as he yells in despair, the chieftain takes his knife and slits his throat leaving him to bleed out on the ground.
The first explorer dies and reaches the gates of heaven, and while he is walking in he sees the second explorer running to catch up with him. “Why are you here? I thought you only had ten small cherries with you?” The first guy asks him.
The second explorer laughs and says “ Well all was going fine and I was just sliding the ninth cherry inside, but then I saw our friend dragging a cart of the largest pineapples have seen behind him and I burst out laughing!”",768,True,False,1

238,"Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...",44561,0.85,"If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.

However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other

The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

The Rabbi pulled out an apple.

With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever. The Jews could stay in Italy!

Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, 'First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs.' 'Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us.' 'Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'He bested me at every move and I could not continue!'

Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won. 'I don't have a clue!!!' the Rabbi said. 'First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger.' Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here. 'And then what?' asked a woman. 'Who knows...' said the Rabbi.

244,Two boys in Egypt free a crocodile...,44403,0.84,"In a small village in Egypt lived two orphan boys, Set and Amenhotep. They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.

One day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher’s snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.

Once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! “Thank you, young men” said the fairy, “Your hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?”

“This is my friend Set, and you can call me ‘Ep’”, said Amenhotep.

“Very well, Ep” said the fairy “What is the desire of your heart?”

“I wish I was the strongest man in the world!” Amenhotep wished. 

“Very well”, said the fairy, “but you must always use your strength to help others.” Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles. 

The fairy turned to Set “And what is your wish, Set?”
Set responded “I never want to be poor again! I wish for money!”

“Very well,” said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. “Greetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!”

“Elmon is an expert in all things money,” said the fairy, “He will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.”

Amenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname “Imp”. With Elmon’s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.  

Years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep. 

Ep and Set’s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business. 

As all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the the HQ in Cairo to learn business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.

Josep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.

Upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature’s effect on Set’s fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.

Josep was shocked, and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.

Amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.

Without the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set’s case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. “Come, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let’s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.”

Set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon’s murder.

The case was brought before the court, but Set’s claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.

Obviously, Ep’s teen didn’t kill Imp’s elf.",857,False,False,1

255,There was this tramp.,44124,0.74,"One cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

Without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. He managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. He took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

Coincidentally the father drives up. ""How can I ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""Just name your price - I'm a wealthy man.""

""Ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, I'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""Oh dear,"" says the father, ""I don't carry much cash with me, I only have ten pounds - but come home with me and I'll get more from the safe.""

""No! No!"" says the tramp, ""Why ten pounds is more money than I've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""Ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

He finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""I'll have one holiday please!""

""Ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""Oh, any holiday I don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""TEN POUNDS! You'll NEVER get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

She goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. There - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""Well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""I've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""Yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""I'll take it!""

A few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""Get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""But I've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and I want on!""

""Well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, I don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. Come back at midnight when it's dark and I'll let you on then.""

So the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""Psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. It was the captain.

""Hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

The tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

First they went down through the first class level: Oriental carpets - 6"" pile. A genuine Rembrandt on every wall. Leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

Then the second class: As above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""Sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""A room of my very own.""

""I'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... Your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. So that's what the alarm clock is for. Enjoy your cruise.""

Well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. Sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. One-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

Then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. He had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

He climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

Perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

Now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""That was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""Where did you learn to dive like that?""

""Um, well I've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""Well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""I've never seen..."" He broke off. ""Hey, I've got an idea"", he started again. ""How would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. I'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""It's a deal!"" says our man. For the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. Back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

Then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""Okay, I'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. We're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""Okay,"" agreed the tramp.

Two days passed, and the big day arrived. The ship was humming with excitement. Everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. The captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. Gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. Higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""Well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""Let's see what you can do."" And with that the Captain handed him a walkie talkie. And the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

Down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""I CAN SEE HIM!"" yelled a passenger, ""LOOK!!!""

The tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

NOT A RIPPLE ON THE SURFACE!

SMASHED THROUGH THE POOL BOTTOM!

DOWN THROUGH THE FIRST DECK!

SMASHING THROUGH THE SECOND!

SMASH!

Into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

Desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

Up and up, desperate, gasping...

Out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""HERO!"" ""WONDERFUL!"" ""AMAZING!"" ""GOOD SHOW THAT!""

And handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""Well tramp, I have NEVER seen anything like that, EVER. That was the most *STUPENDOUS* piece of diving I have ever seen.""

The tramp blushed.

The captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

And the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""Well you see...

""For me to tell you, I'll need $49.95""

The captain outrageously asked why.

The tramp said

Later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. On the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.

As we passed, they all said in unison, ""You may now kiss the bride!"" My wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which I of course returned.

""No,"" Donald said. ""I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

So Jeremiah and Timothy have wild sex on the plane.

The first guy answers, ""That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!""

The policeman says, ""Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile.""

Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""

The second guy smiles, flips his hair and says, ""Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""

The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?!!? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""

Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?

He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""

The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""The suspect wears contact lenses.""

The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not.

""Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that.""

He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.

""Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?""

Only this time, she plays left-handed.

The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.

They're totally amazed.

They can't figure her out.

She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.

They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.

The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.

This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.

The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.

However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.

This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.

They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, ""How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?""

The lady blushes, and grins. ""When my dad taught me to play golf, I learned that I was ambidextrous."" she replies. ""I like to switch back and forth.""

""When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed.""

No more was said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep.
Around two in the morning the husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen and returned a while later with a sandwich and a glass of milk.

316,"4 years ago today, I shared the worst joke I ever created. Here it is again for those that missed it.",42051,0.85,"There are two identical twin brothers that live together. One happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. Instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. One Saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. He tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. After some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. In the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. He turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
About 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. His vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. An ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. He ends up in the Emergency Room under observation, but his condition is critical. They try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
The dentist wakes to a knock on the door. Suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. Eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. When he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. He is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
The grim reaper swears. ""Oh no! This always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""What do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""Well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and I've come to take him to the underworld. I'm afraid his time on Earth has ended. I'll take my leave now.""  
  
The dentist is noticeably upset. He says ""Wait! Isn't there some way I can challenge you for my brother's life? After all, YOU made the mistake. Certainly there must be a way I can bargain for his life.""  
  
The grim reaper asks ""What do you have in mind?""  
  
The dentist thinks. ""How about a challenge? If I beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
The grim reaper laughs. ""I will beat you in any challenge. What challenge do you propose?""  
  
The dentist smiles. ""I propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""Very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
Once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. It's glistening. He takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. After 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. The grim reaper grins. ""You are foolish human. But, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
The dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. When his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. He smiles.  
  
It's unbelievable.  
  
The shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
The winner is obvious. The grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""You win, human. This time. Your brother will live."" He disappears in a puff of smoke. At the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. Not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. Suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. It's his brother, the dentist. He picks up. ""Hey bro. You'll never believe what happened. Apparently, I went out to the market and got hit by a car. They say I almost died.""  
  
The dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""That's interesting, bro. Today you might say that I also had a brush with death.""",1038,False,False,1

Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. 

Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, ""Is the coming winter going to be cold?""

""It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,"" the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.

A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Is it going to be a very cold winter?""

""Yes,"" the man at National Weather Service again replied,""it's definitely going to be a very cold winter."" The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.

Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. ""Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?""

""Absolutely,"" the man replied. ""It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever.""

""Yes"", she says, ""I remember it well.""

OK, he says, ""How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.

The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.

So, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?""

Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

""Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.""",450,False,False,1

shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away."" 

The distressed woman wailed, 
""Are you sure?""
""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied 
the vet.. 

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or 
something."" 

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later 
with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat
back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. 

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" 

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and 
produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, 
the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.""

The year is 2028 and the United States has elected the first woman as well as the first Jewish president, Sarah Goldstein.

""I don't think so. It's a ten-hour drive, your father isn't as young as he used to be, and my arthritis is acting up again.""

""Don't worry about it, Mom, I'll send Air Force One to pick you up and take you home. And a limousine will pick you up at your door.""

""I don't know. Everybody will be so fancy-schmantzy; what on earth would I wear?

Sarah replies, ""I'll make sure you have a wonderful gown, custom-made by the best designer in New York.""

""Honey,"" Mom complains, ""you know I can't eat those rich foods you and your friends like to eat.""

The President-to-be responds, ""Don't worry Mom. The entire affair is going to be handled by the best caterer in New York; kosher all the way Mom, I really want you to come.""

So Mom reluctantly agrees and on January 20, 2029, Sarah Goldstein is being sworn in as President of the United States.

News began to circulate of a Russian wrestler who was fierce and unstoppable. As each wrestlers legends grew, a match was set up between the two, America versus Russia. The match would be held in Texas.

John began training immediately. Every day his coach would tell him, “This Russian has a move called the Mongolian Death Grip. No one has ever escaped the Mongolian Death Grip. DO NOT let him get you in the Mongolian Death Grip”

The day of the match finally came. Just before each wrestler stepped onto the mat in front of the capacity crowd, the coach once again said, “Whatever you do, do not let him get you in the Mongolian death grip. No one has ever escaped the Mongolian death grip”. 

Four seconds into the match, the Russian had the American in the Mongolian death grip. The coach buried his face into his hands and cursed John for not listening to his advice. All of the sudden he heard the crowd irrupt in a chant of USA USA USA. He looked up and saw the Russian pinned by John. The coach ran out to meet John and embarrassingly told him, “I didn’t see... Once he had you in the Mongolian Death Grip I looked away. How in the world did you get out of the Mongolian death grip?”

With heavy breath, John told him “Well coach, that Russian grabbed me and twisted my body in ways I never imagined possible. I was wincing in pain when I open my eyes and right in front of me were two testicles. So I bit them.”

“What???” Said the coach... “John I don’t think that is legal. You could be disqualified”

“I don’t know about that coach. But I can tell you one thing. You ain’t got no idea how strong you are until you bite your own balls”

He particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. He was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.


But his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.


Wishing to save his prized pet, Attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. None of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.


Attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a Christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.


But the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. Enraged, Attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.


Standing before Attila, the old man calmly said, ""Before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""


Curious, Attila did as he asked.


Then the old man took some bread and gave it to Attila.


""Now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.


Attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.


To an amazed Attila, the old man simply said,

Completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: ""Welp, I've been wrong all my life and I guess I'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith""

Satan laughs and replies: ""Awh it's not so bad down here, let me give you the tour so you can see for yourself""

He then proceeds to escort Jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other ""damned"" live.

As they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize Satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, request that's always granted by the two.

Every time they stop to a house Satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person.

At sunset the devil sees that Jack was very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity into.

As they walk to Jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and Jack asks: ""What's behind there?""

Satan: ""Oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind""

Despite his curiosity Jack thought better not to bother Satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where Satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day.

That night however Jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he's in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day.

After a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that Satan couldn't even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was.

Once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall.

Jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be.

On the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help.

Jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the Devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair.

The following morning Satan showed up once again and told Jack to come with him.

Jack pleaded: ""PLEASE! PLEASE! Don't take me to hell, I'll do anything just let me stay here, I don't wanna burn for all eternity!""

Satan: ""What are you talking about??? I'm just gonna show you the recreational center like I told you yesterday""

Jack: ""Don't lie to me, I saw what was going on behind the giant wall!""

Satan: ""Ooooh you saw that! Don't worry  that's not for you, that's the Christian hell""

Jack: ""The christian hell? Why would the christian hell be like that?""

Satan: ""I don't know either man, they just want it that way""

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""

Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. 

Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

Author’s Notes: WOW! Never thought this would get this much feedback. A few clarifications for anyone asking: 
1. I was in the back end of the kitchen with a fellow cook during a quieter lunch hour when this happened. The place I was working at had been opened less than a month. We had been swapping jokes for a bit before I let this one loose and instead of it being muffled by the sounds of the deep fryer, grill, etc., it was projected out into the main seating area through the ticket window like a speaker. 

2. A customer was the one who ultimately complained to the manager and I was gracefully fired the following day when I walked in to start my shift. I had come from working at a bar previously, so the fact that more sensitive people/families were the ones showing up completely slipped my mind as I was in the back cracking joke with the other chef (a  10+ year veteran of the industry.)The owner was pretty cool with everything all things considered, but explained that they just couldn’t take the risk of something else happening. I even got to say goodbye to everyone before I left, including the head chef who originally hired me, and everyone was really supportive and understanding. 

3. I got a new job shortly after in a warehouse and have been much better off since. I make more money, work less hours, have actual benefits and my bosses are WAY less uptight due to the nature of the job. It was the strangest blessing in disguise I’ve ever received as I don’t know how much longer I wouldn’t lasted in the food industry either way.

The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power.

The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. The first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. The second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. 


The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. 


In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. 


The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom. 


And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

this huge house all to myself, but I'm recently widowed,' she explained. 'I'm afraid the neighbors

got on their way.

unexpected letter from an attorney. It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined 
that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend.

do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up north about
9 months ago?'

Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?""

The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, ""Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!""

The policeman angrily responds, ""What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?""

Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, ""This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, ""Think hard before giving me a stupid answer.""

The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, ""the suspect wears contact lenses.""

The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not. 

""Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that."" He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.

""Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?""

210,“Knock Knock”,18,0.92,"“so sorry to keep you waiting!"" he was going to say, when he saw that it was not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, and very bright eyes under his dark-green hood. As soon a the door was opened, he pushed inside, just as if he had been expected. He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and ""Dwalin at your service!"" he said with a low bow.

""Bilbo Baggins at yours!"" said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions for the moment. When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he added: ""I am just about to take tea; pray come and have some with me."" A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?

They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, when there came another even louder ring at the bell. ""Excuse me!"" said the hobbit, and off he went to the door. ""So you have got here at last!"" was what he was going to say to Gandalf this time. But it was not Gandalf. Instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been invited. ""I see they have begun to arrive already,"" he said when he caught sight of Dwalin's green hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and ""Balin at your service!"" he said with his hand on his breast.

""Thank you!"" said Bilbo with a gasp. It was not the correct thing to say, but they have begun to arrive had flustered him badly. He liked visitors, but he liked to know them before they arrived, and he preferred to ask them himself. He had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short, and then he-as the host: he knew his duty and stuck to it however painful-he might have to go without.


""Come along in, and have some tea!"" he managed to say after taking a deep breath.

""A little beer would suit me better, if it is all the same to you, my good sir,"" said Balin with the white beard. ""But I don't mind some cake-seed-cake, if you have any.""

""Lots!"" Bilbo found himself answering, to his own surprise; and he found himself scuttling off, too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and to the pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed-cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his after-supper morsel.

When he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends (as a matter of fact they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another ring.

""Gandalf for certain this time,"" he thought as he puffed along the passage. But it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade. In they hopped, as soon as the door began to open-Bilbo was hardly surprised at all.

""What can I do for you, my dwarves?"" he said. ""Kili at your service!""

said the one. ""And Fili!"" added the other; and they both swept off their blue hoods and bowed.

""At yours and your family's!"" replied Bilbo, remembering his manners this time.

""Dwalin and Balin here already, I see,"" said Kili. ""Let us join the throng!""

""Throng!"" thought Mr. Baggins. ""I don't like the sound of that. I really must sit down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink."" He had only just had a sip-in the corner, while the four dwarves sat around the table, and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they sounded much too adventurous-when, ding-dong-a-ling-' dang, his bell rang again, as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. ""Someone at the door!"" he said, blinking. ""Some four, I should say by the sound,"" said Fili. ""Be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance.""

The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and wondered what had happened, and what was going to happen, and whether they would all stay to supper. Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not four after all, it was FIVE. Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, be-x)re they were all inside, bowing and saying ""at your service"" one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while. A big jug of coffee bad just been set in the hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones, when there came-a loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit's beautiful green door. Somebody was banging with a stick!

Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and bewuthered-this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More dwarves, four more! And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before. ""Carefully! Carefully!"" he said. ""It is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!"" ""At your service!"" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted ""pray don't mention it,"" and stopped frowning.

""Now we are all here!"" said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods-the best detachable party hoods-and his own hat hanging on the pegs. ""Quite a merry gathering!

I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's that? Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think, for me."" ""And for me,"" said Thorin. ""And raspberry jam and apple-tart,"" said Bifur. ""And mince-pies and cheese,"" said Bofur. ""And pork-pie and salad,"" said Bombur. ""And more cakes-and ale-and coffee, if you don't mind,"" called the other dwarves through the door.

""Put on a few eggs, there's a good fellow!"" Gandalf called after him, as

the hobbit stumped off to the pantries. ""And just bring out the cold chicken and pickles!""

""Seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself!"" thought Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house. By the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was getting very hot, and red in the face, and annoyed.

""Confusticate and bebother these dwarves!"" he said aloud. ""Why don't they come and lend a hand?"" Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and Fili and Kili behind them, and before he could say knife they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out everything afresh.

Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen, dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and. not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses. ""I suppose you will all stay to supper?"" he said in his politest unpressing tones. ""Of course!"" said Thorin. ""And after. We shan't get through the business till late, and we must have some music first. Now to clear up!"" Thereupon the twelve dwarves-not Thorin, he was too important, and stayed talking to Gandalf-jumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things. Off they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright: ""please be careful!"" and ""please, don't trouble! I can manage."" But the dwarves only started to sing:

""Chip the glasses and crack the plates!
Blunt the knives and bend the forks!
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates-
Smash the bottles and burn the corks!
Cut the cloth and tread on the fat!
Pour the milk on the pantry floor!
Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!
Splash the wine on every door!
Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl;
Pound them up with a thumping pole;
And when you've finished, if any are whole,
Send them down the hall to roll!
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!
So, carefully! carefully with the plates!""

And of course they did none of these dreadful things, and everything was cleaned and put away safe as quick as lightning, while the hobbit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen trying to see what they were doing. Then they went back, and found Thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a pipe. He was blowing the most enormous smoke-rings, and wherever he told one to go, it went-up the chimney, or behind the clock on the man-telpiece, or under the table, or round and round the ceiling; but wherever it went it was not quick enough to escape Gandalf. Pop! he sent a smaller smoke-ring from his short clay-pipe straight through each one of Thorin's. The Gandalf's smoke-ring would go green and come back to hover over the wizard's head. He had quite a cloud of them about him already, and in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous. Bilbo stood still and watched-he loved smoke-rings-and then be blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the smoke-rings he had sent up the wind over The Hill. ""Now for some music!"" said Thorin. ""Bring out the instruments!""

Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles;

Dori, Nori, and Ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced a drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur went out too, and came back with clarinets that they had left among the walking-sticks Dwalin and Balin said: ""Excuse me, I left mine in the porch!"" ""Just bring mine in with you,"" said Thorin. They came back with viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin's harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a beautiful gold-en harp, and when Thorin struck it the music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that Bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons, far over The Water and very far from his hobbit-hole under The Hill. The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of The Hill; the firelight flickered-it was April-and still they played on, while the shadow of Gandalf's beard wagged against the wall. The dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were lost, and still they played on. And suddenly first one and then another began to sing as they played, deep-throated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of their ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their song without their music.

""Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To seek the pale enchanted gold.

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep, where dark things sleep,
In hollow halls beneath the fells.

For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gloaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
The dragon-fire, in twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun.

Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day,
To claim our long-forgotten gold.

Goblets they carved there for themselves
And harps of gold; where no man delves
There lay they long, and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves.

The pines were roaring on the height,
The winds were moaning in the night.
The fire was red, it flaming spread;
The trees like torches biased with light,

The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale;
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire
Laid low their towers and houses frail.

The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
They fled their hall to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.

Far over the misty mountains grim
To dungeons deep and caverns dim
We must away, ere break of day,
To win our harps and gold from him!""

As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. He looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up - probably somebody lighting a wood-fire-and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames. He shuddered; and very quickly he was plain Mr. Baggins of Bag-End, Under-Hill, again. He got up trembling. He had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more than half a mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the beer barrels in the cellar, and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away. Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him with eyes shining in the dark.

""Where are you going?"" said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he guessed both halves of the hobbit's mind.

""What about a little light?"" said Bilbo apologetically.

""We like the dark,"" said the dwarves. ""Dark for dark business! There are many hours before dawn.""

""Of course!"" said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the stool and sat in the fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash. ""Hush!"" said Gandalf. ""Let Thorin speak!"" And this is bow Thorin began. ""Gandalf, dwarves and Mr. Baggins! We are not together in the house of our friend and fellow conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbit-may the hair on his toes never fall out! all praise to his wine and ale!-"" He paused for breath and for a polite remark from the hob-bit, but the compliments were quite lost on-poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed. So Thorin went on:

""We are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices. We shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which some of us, or perhaps all of us (except our friend and counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object is, I take it, well known to us all. To the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves (I think I should be right in naming Kili and Fili, for instance), the exact situation at the moment may require a little brief explanation-"" This was Thorin's style. He was an important dwarf. If he had been allowed, he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath, without telling any one there 'anything that was not known already. But he was rudely interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn't bear it any longer. At may never return he began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang Bp knocking over the table. Gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff, and in its firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the floor, and kept on calling out ""struck by lightning, struck by lightning!"" over and over again; and that was all they could get out of him for a long time. So they took him and laid him out of the way on the drawing-room sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark business.

""Excitable little fellow,"" said Gandalf, as they sat down again. ""Gets funny queer fits, but he is one of the best, one of the best-as fierce as a dragon in a pinch.""

If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realise that this was only poetical exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to Old Took's great-granduncle Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a horse. He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields, and knocked their king Gol-firnbul's head clean off with a wooden club. It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment.

In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer's gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-room. After a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the parlour. This is what he heard, Gloin speaking: ""Humph!"" (or some snort more or less like that). ""Will he do, do you think? It is all very well for Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill the lot of us. I think it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it bad not been for the sign on the door, I should have been sure we had come to the wrong house. As soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat, I had my doubts. He looks more like a grocer-than a burglar!""

Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. As for little fellow bobbing on the mat it almost made him really fierce. Many a time afterwards the Baggins part regretted what he did now, and he said to himself: ""Bilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it.""

""Pardon me,"" he said, ""if I have overheard words that you were saying. I don't pretend to understand what you are talking about, or your reference to burglars, but I think I am right in believing"" (this is what he called being on his dignity) ""that you think I am no good. I will show you. I have no signs on my door-it was painted a week ago-, and I am quite sure you have come to the wrong house. As soon as I saw your funny faces on the door-step, I had my doubts. But treat it as the right one. Tell me what you want done, and I will try it, if I have to walk from here to the East of East and fight the wild Were-worms in the Last Desert. I bad a great-great-great-granduncle once, Bullroarer Took, and -"" ""Yes, yes, but that was long ago,"" said Gloin. ""I was talking about you. And I assure you there is a mark on this door-the usual one in the trade, or used to be. Burglar wants a good job, plenty of Excitement and reasonable Reward, that's how it is usually read. You ^an say Expert Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar if you like. Some of them do. It's all the same to us. Gandalf told us that there was a man of the sort in these parts looking for a Job at once, and that he had arranged for a meeting here this Wednesday tea-time.""

""Of course there is a mark,"" said Gandalf. ""I put it there myself. For very good reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins. Just let any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go back to digging coal.""

He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when Bilbo tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at him and stuck oat his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap. ""That's right,"" said Gandalf. ""Let's have no more argument. I have chosen Mr. Baggins and that ought to !6te enough for all of you. If I say he is a Burglar, a Burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. You may (possibly) all live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and let's have little light on this!""

On the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shad he spread a piece of parchment rather like a map.

""This was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin, he said in answer to the dwarves' excited questions. ""It is a plan of the Mountain."" ""I don't see that this will help us much,"" said Thorin disappointedly after a glance. ""I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred.""

""There is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain, said Balin, ""but it will be easy enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive there."" ""There is one point that you haven't noticed,"" said the wizard, ""and that is the secret entrance. You see that rune on the West side, and the hand pointing to it from the other runes? That marks a hidden passage to the Lower Halls.

""It may have been secret once,"" said Thorin, ""but how do we know that it is secret any longer? Old Smaug had lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves.""

""He may-but he can't have used it for years and years. ""Why?"" ""Because it is too small. 'Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast' say the runes, but Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale.""

""It seems a great big hole to me,"" squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and only of hobbit-holes) He was getting excited and interested again, so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. He loved maps, and in his hall there hung a large one of the Country Round with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink. ""How could such a large door be kept secret from everybody outside, apart from the dragon?"" he asked. He was only a little hobbit you must remember.

""In lots of ways,"" said Gandalf. ""But in what way this one has been hidden we don't know without going to see. From what it says on the map I should guess there is a closed door which has been made to look exactly like the side of the Mountain. That is the usual dwarves' method - I think that is right, isn't it?"" ""Quite right,"" said Thorin.

""Also,"" went on Gandalf, ""I forgot to mention that with the map went a key, a small and curious key. Here it is!"" he said, and handed to Thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate wards, made of silver. ""Keep it safe!"" ""Indeed I will,"" said Thorin, and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck and under his jacket. ""Now things begin to look more hopeful. This news alters them much for-the better. So far we have had no clear idea what to do. We thought of going East, as quiet and careful as we could, as far as the Long Lake. After that the trouble would begin."" ""A long time before that, if I know anything about the loads East,"" interrupted Gandalf.

""We might go from there up along the River Running,"" went on Thorin taking no notice, ""and so to the ruins of Dale-the old town in the valley there, under the shadow of the Mountain. But we none of us liked the idea of the Front Gate. The river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the South of the Mountain, and out of it comes the dragon too-far too often, unless he has changed.""

""That would be no good,"" said the wizard, ""not without a mighty Warrior, even a Hero. I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply lot to be found. Swords in these parts are mostly blunt, and axes are used for trees, and shields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons are comfortably far-off (and therefore legendary). That is why I settled on burglary-especially when I remembered the existence of a Side-door. And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let's get on and make some plans.""

""Very well then,"" said Thorin, ""supposing the burglar-expert gives us some ideas or suggestions."" He turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo. ""First I should like to know a bit more about things,"" said he, feeling all confused and a bit shaky inside, but so far still lookishly determined to go on with things. ""I mean about the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how it got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and further."" ""Bless me!"" said Thorin, ""haven't you got a map? and didn't you hear our song? and haven't we been talking about all this for hours?""

""All the same, I should like it all plain and clear,"" said he

obstinately, putting on his business manner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off him), and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to Gandalf's recommendation. ""Also I should like to know about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time required and remuneration, and so forth""-by which he meant: ""What am I going to get out of it? and am I going to come back alive?""

""O very well,"" said Thorin. ""Long ago in my grandfather Thror's time our family was driven out of the far North, and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the map. It had been discovered by my far ancestor, Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled and they made huger halls and greater workshops -and in addition I believe they found a good deal of gold and a great many jewels too. Anyway they grew immensely rich and famous, and my grandfather was King under the Mountain again and treated with great reverence by the mortal men, who lived to the South, and were gradually spreading up the Running River as far as the valley overshadowed by the Mountain. They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for our smiths, and reward even the least skilful most richly. Fathers would beg us to take their sons as apprentices, and pay us handsomely, especially in food-supplies, which we never bothered to grow or find for ourselves. Altogether those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the. fun of it, not to speak of the most marvellous and magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in the world now-a-days. So my grandfather's halls became full of armour and jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy-market of Dale was the wonder of the North.

""Undoubtedly that was what brought the dragon. Dragons steal gold and jewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them; and they guard their plunder as long as they live (which is practically forever, unless they are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad, though they usually have a good notion of the current market value; and they can't make a thing for themselves, not even mend a little loose scale of their armour. There were lots of dragons in the North in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the dwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse. There was a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm called Smaug. One day he flew up into the air and came south. The first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the North, and the pine-trees on the Mountain creaking and cracking in the wind. Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside (I was one luckily -a fine adventurous lad in those days, always wandering about, and it saved my life that day)-well, from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. Then he came down the slopes and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire. By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there was the dragon waiting for them. None escaped that way. The river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale, and in the fog the dragon came on them and destroyed most of the warriors-the usual unhappy story, it was only too common in those days. Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the halls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and passages. After that there were no dwarves left alive inside, and he took all their wealth for himself. Probably, for that is the dragons' way, he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed. Later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale, and carry away people, especially maidens, to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all the people dead or gone. What goes on there now I don't know for certain, but I don't suppose anyone lives nearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake now-a-days.

""The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards. They looked very grim but they said very little. When I asked how they had got away, they told me to hold my tongue, and said that one day in the proper time I should know. After that we went away, and we have had to earn our livings as best we could up and down the lands, often enough sinking as low as blacksmith-work or even coalmining. But we have never forgotten our stolen treasure. And even now, when I will allow we have a good bit laid by and are not so badly off""-here Thorin stroked the gold chain round his neck-""we still mean to get it back, and to bring our curses home to Smaug-if we can.

""I have often wondered about my father's and my grandfather's escape. I see now they must have had a private Side-door which only they knew about. But apparently they made a map, and I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of it, and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir."" ""I did not 'get hold of it,' I was given it,"" said the wizard. ""Your grandfather Thror was killed, you remember, in the mines of Moria by Azog the Goblin -"" ""Curse his name, yes,"" said Thorin.

""And Thrain your father went away on the twenty-first of April, a hundred years ago last Thursday, and has never been seen by you since-"" ""True, true,"" said Thorin.

""Well, your father gave me this to give to you; and if I have chosen my own time and way of handing it over, you can hardly blame me, considering the trouble I had to find you. Your father could not remember his own name when he gave me the paper, and he never told me yours; so on the whole I think I ought to be praised and thanked. Here it is,"" said he handing the map to Thorin. ""I don't understand,"" said Thorin, and Bilbo felt he would have liked to say the same. The explanation did not seem to explain. ""Your grandfather,"" said the wizard slowly and grimly, ""gave the map to his son for safety before he went to the mines of Moria. Your father went away to try his luck with the map after your grandfather was killed; and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had, but he never got near the Mountain. How he got there I don't know, but I found him a prisoner in the dungeons of the Necromancer.""

""Whatever were you doing there?"" asked Thorin with a shudder, and all the dwarves shivered.

""Never you mind. I was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty dangerous business it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save your father, but it was too late. He was witless and wandering, and had forgotten almost everything except the map and the key."" ""We have long ago paid the goblins of Moria,"" said Thorin; ""we must give a thought to the Necromancer."" ""Don't be absurd! He is an enemy quite beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together, if they could all be collected again from the four corners of the world. The one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map and use the key. The dragon and the Mountain are more than big enough tasks for you!""

""Hear, hear!"" said Bilbo, and accidentally said it aloud, ""Hear what?"" they all said turning suddenly towards him, and he was so flustered that he answered ""Hear what I have got to say!"" ""What's that?"" they asked. ""Well, I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round.

After all there is the Side-door, and dragons must sleep sometimes, I suppose.

If you sit on the doorstep long enough, I daresay you will think of something. And well, don't you know, I think we have talked long enough for one night, if you see what I mean. What about bed, and an early start, and all that? I will give you a good breakfast before you go.""

""Before we go, I suppose you mean,"" said Thorin. ""Aren't you the burglar? And isn't sitting on the door-step your job, not to speak of getting inside the door? But I agree about bed and breakfast. I like eggs with my ham, when starting on a journey: fried not poached, and mind you don't break 'em.""

After all the others had ordered their breakfasts without so much as a please (which annoyed Bilbo very much), they all got up. The hobbit had to find room for them all, and filled all his spare-rooms and made beds on chairs and sofas, before he got them all stowed and went to his own little bed very tired and not altogether happy. One thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to get up very early and cook everybody else's wretched breakfast. The Tookishness was wearing off, and he was not now quite so sure that he was going on any journey in the morning. As he lay in bed he could hear Thorin still humming to himself in the best bedroom next to him:

""Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day,
To find our long-forgotten gold.""

Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears, and it gave him very uncomfortable dreams. It was long after the break of day, when he woke up.",3,False,False,4

291,Why did Oscar the flaming and flamboyant homosexual man express that he could never consider a woman’s ‘axe wound’ as something he could ever take pleasure in?,9,1.0,"Well when Oscar was 4 years old he witnessed his abusive psychopathic father lodge an axe into his mother’s abdomen and ever since that moment he has never taken pleasure in seeing an axe wound in a woman. To be honest he probably wouldn’t have ever found it appealing even if he hadn’t been traumatised. After his mothers death from bleeding out and his fathers imprisonment Oscar was placed in a foster home - and was eventually adopted, but unfortunately he was old enough to remember the brutal act of his father chopping into his mother with an axe. He has been attending trauma Councilling for years which sadly rarely ever helped his severe PTSD, in fact he has been diagnosed with an array of other mental health conditions common to a man that experienced a trauma during childhood. With the help of years of therapy, medication and finding the love of his life (Bernard) he is finally able to start talking about his traumatic experience which is why he has been stating openly that he could never take pleasure in a woman’s axe wound. Frankly he couldn’t take pleasure in seeing an axe wound regardless if it was inflicted on a male or a female. But he is coming to terms with the fact that the axe wound that was lodged into his *mother’s* abdomen, a woman, which was also lodged into his psyche. He is trying a new technique while working with his therapist of talking openly about his trauma to Bernard in a casual way so as to defuse the notion that his abhorrent aversion to his memory of his mother’s axe wound that eventually killed her is now no more than a statement that ‘that’s not something I could ever take pleasure in’.... this alludes to the fact that Oscars father perhaps took pleasure in using an axe on his wife, but that’s something that oscars therapist hopes to address in the future. For now, oscars therapist is glad that he’s talking candidly about his mother’s ‘axe wound’ because it’s a step away from denial and instead a turn towards acceptance.",0,False,False,4

417,A man walks into a bar...,17,0.95,"... he says ""Ow.""

The thing is, he knows that the old pull-up bar is hanging on the frame to the basement door. It's been there for years. But he... forgot it, somehow? Didn't duck, went full speed right into it, forehead first. There's a ringing in his ears, the vision in his left eye blurring. ""Just rung my bell again."" 

The memory problems started about ten years ago. It didn't make sense - he was only in his thirties. There was no history of mental weakness in his family, yet here he was, forgetting why he left the house, forgetting anniversaries. Judith! Right, Judy could help him get back up the stairs. ""Honey, I'm feeling a little dizzy here..."" 

No answer came, of course. She left him three years ago. She tried, good lord she tried so hard. But the mood swings and night terrors and uncharacteristic, unpredictable violent rages were too much. The man she loved was being hallowed out before her eyes, lost atom by atom to coalescing black holes of degenerating grey matter.

The pain of his loneliness came rushing back into him, as if anew, but probably for the hundredth time. The pain in his head was now joined by one in his heart. She left him just like they all left him. The doctors and their lies. ""CTE my ass.""

He was an athlete! Playing the O-Line was relatively anonymous, but his peers knew him well. He had raw power tempered by affability, a gentle giant of good humor and greater football IQ. His job was to be a tank, absorb the hits, which he did with ease. There were dozens of concussions he knew about - often shrugged off after the impartial medical advice of coaches who would assure him that he just ""rung his bell."" There were uncountable subconcussive hits. He endured the bloodsport for twenty years, with nothing left to show for it but chronic traumatic encephalopathy. 

The money is gone, family and friends are gone, memory is gone, health is gone. But he's got the bottle, thank god he's got the bottle. Judith tried to get him to stop, the doctors all said it wasn't helping, but what the fuck do they know?! Alcohol is the only thing helping right now. 

Ach, the gin. That's why he came downstairs. He can't stand gin, but he's out of everything else and the credit cards are frozen. He turns around to go back down, muttering that Judith should just go to the liquor store. Maybe he didn't see it, maybe he forgot:

454,A horse walks into a bar,15,0.94,"A horse walks into a bar and the bartender asks, “why the long face?”

The horse says, ""hypothetically, imagine that through whatever course of human evolution, for some reason when men ejaculate, entire babies are shot out. Let's also imagine that these babies need to be placed in a woman in order to germinate completely, so this doesn't change the overall process of having a child at all. In fact, these babies are quite small, maybe only a tablespoon in volume. Only one can come out in any given session unless you've been edging for a while or are more pent up than usual. They swim up the fallopian tubes as sperm would, and the woman's body knows how to plug them into their uterine lining somehow. The babies cannot survive on their own outside of a womb for much more than, say, five minutes. In those five minutes, they are much like fish out of water. Flopping about, doing the only thing their as of yet undeveloped neural systems know how to do: trying to swim up. Eventually, they die, and you're left with a grape-sized humanoid smeared on whatever sheet, or sock, or person’s back you're partial to leaving such things on. 

""In such a world, would abortion be more, or less accepted? On the one hand, we have complete proof that these fetuses have some sort of mental capacity. They are capable of surviving, at least for a short time, and can react to stimuli. They can even make moderately intelligent choices in order to navigate their way through the female anatomy, otherwise, they would 'get lost' and the human species would promptly become sterile. Following this thread, it seems like we would be less likely to allow abortions. With the image of someone literally shooting a baby into someone, it seems humans, in general, would decide that there is enough sapience there that we couldn't kill it. It seems in this scenario that paradoxically life begins before conception. Being kicked in the balls would near genocide, the equivalent of kicking a satchel full of children with a steel-toed boot.

""On the other hand, it may be that we get entirely jaded to the idea of abortion. Every adolescent male would have had to kill thousands upon thousands of fetuses before they turned twenty! The experience of having a wet dream would be even more disturbing, as instead of waking up to a mild stickiness in your sheets, you wake up snuggled up to the corpse of a child. Imagine walking to your child's door, and without warning, you enter his room. Find him hastily hiding the smashed pulp of a fetus he just had to euthanize would be no different than the snapping shut of a laptop now. It almost seems like in this universe we would justify abortions more easily, as all the world's men--who seem to be the biggest proponents of the pro-life argument--would have spent their adolescence performing abortions on themselves every day. 

""The argument could certainly be made that if a grape-sized child came out of you every time you took yourself on a j-date maybe people would take the Catholic church's rules about ""spilling your seed"" a little more seriously, but I think the level of horniness in teenage boys would still outweigh any misguided or otherwise moral compass on masturbation. And what else can they do afterward? It's more cruel not to snap your semen's little spine. Otherwise, it's just going to die from exposure! This is more or less how it is in our universe. Every time one ejaculates, in a way, millions upon millions of potential human lives die of exposure to the hostile elements. The only real difference is they are smaller and look less humanoid. 

""Porn would also take an interesting turn. I'm curious if something like bukkake would still have a place in this universe. Would people still want to watch a woman swallow? Would the bisexual women involved in threesomes kiss a more and more mangled, chewed up baby back and forth only for both of them to swallow pieces of it? How would anal sex work? What happens if you don't pull out, and a baby is just lodged in your large intestine? How much would these babies be fetishized in general? It seems that nearly everything, fluid or excretion related, sexual or not, has a community dedicated to the fetishization of it. If we live in a world with foot fetishists, and individuals obsessed with water or bloodplay, it's harder to believe people wouldn't be into sexualizing their undercooked baby excrement.

""The issue of premature ejaculation is another interesting one in this universe. Imagine being on a date with a cute girl, things are going well, she keeps touching your arms and thighs when she laughs. Long story short, there’s a lot of stimulation going on. Finally, you’re back in her apartment under the pretense of getting some 1 AM coffee (which is a tradition I don’t really understand. Sex or not, do people really want to be drinking coffee that late? That’s just irresponsible). You guys are kissing and cuddling, tongues are moving around--look, this isn't my personal erotica, you can fill in the gaps. One thing leads to another, and you tense up. All of a sudden you and this poor, poor girl look down. She was alerted by a sudden sensation of frantic movement coming from your crotch. The bulge that was there has been replaced with a softer, smaller one, and a bulge that’s flopping around as if you had a water balloon containing a goldfish strapped to your leg, and it suddenly popped. In this universe, you both know what’s just occurred. Instead of terror because there’s a tiny creature (hell, maybe two or three, she was pretty hot) swimming down your pant-leg, you feel embarrassed that you let it out this early. If you try again before a few hours have passed, you’ll just shoot out an arm or a leg, which sucks because unbeknownst to you, this girl is particularly into baby-play. Too bad.

The local Sheriff was looking for a new deputy. When a blonde walks in to try for the job, he asks her,

“What is 1 and 1?”

“Eleven”, she replies.

The Sheriff thinks to himself, “That’s not what I wanted, but I guess she’s right!”

“What are the two days of the week wich begin with the letter T?” he asks.

“Today and Tomorrow”, the blonde answers.

The Sheriff is surprised again that the blonde has supplied a correct answer that had not even occurred to him.

“Now listen carefully, who killed Abe Lincoln?” he asks her. The blonde looks a little surprised. She thinks really hard for a minute and finally admits,

“I don’t know.”

“Well, why don’t you go home and work on that one for a while?”

So, the blonde wanders over to the beauty parlor, where her pals are waiting to hear the results of the interview. The blonde was exultant.

“The interview went great!” she says. “The first day on the job and I’m already working on a murder case!”

“Sir, Karen is one of our most expensive ladies. Perhaps you would prefer someone else,” said the madam.

“No. I must see Karen,” was the man’s reply.

Just then, Karen appeared and announced to the man that she charged 1,000 dollars a visit. Without hesitation, the man pulled out ten one-hundred-dollar bills, gave them to Karen, and they went upstairs. After an hour, the man calmly left.

The next night, the same man appeared again, demanding to see Karen. Karen explained that none had ever come back two nights in a row – too expensive – and there were no discounts. The price was still 1,000 dollars. Again the man pulled out the money, gave it to Karen and they went upstairs. After an hour, he left.

The following night the man was there again. Everyone was astounded that he had come for the third consecutive night, but he paid Karen and they went upstairs. After their session, Karen questioned the man.

“No one has ever been with me three nights in a row. Where are you from?” she asked.

The man replied, “New Jersey.”

As you have freed me from my prison, I will grant you three wishes!"" The man carefully considers his options. He decides that he should wish himself back to safety as his third wish, for if he does so immediately he may lose the lamp and forfeit his other two. 

He commands the genie: ""I wish that I were the richest man in the world!"" 

The genie snaps his fingers and replies ""Done! When you return to your home, you will find that half of the world's wealth belongs to you!""

The man, eager to keep his good fortune going, says ""I also wish that I were king of the world!""

The genie again snaps his fingers and booms ""As you wish! From now on, every nation and tribe will bow to your rule!""

Who would have thought that I would not only make something of myself but become the single most important figure of all time? My parents would realize they were all wrong about me if they were still around. I wish I could see the look on their stupid faces.""

The genie, knowing the man may have been unaware that the phrasing of his monologue would expend his final wish, asks him ""This is your third and final wish. Is this your final answer?""

The man, realizing how close he was to wasting his last wish and dying in the cave, proclaims ""Of course not, how foolish of me! I wish to be transported from this cave to my home with my injuries healed""

Humans personalize these numbers for the burst of dopamine in their empty lives called humor, and if you really want this humor, take it.

Life will go on, while these numbers can't feel, we can! We deserve this happiness in our lives, there's nothing wrong with it, all it is is a few simple words to make someone feel slightly better.

Except, they're not. It's a very common few simple words, if they've heard it they may not laugh again, they might not have even laughed the first time. It's not a magic spell you cast upon someone to make them enjoy themselves. How are these three words going to change anything in the grand scheme of things? Life is uncontrollable, sometimes things happen and you can't stop them, and life is unpredictable. You'll never see it coming, so the real question is is it better to try in case it works, or to not in case it backfires?

This, however, *is* controllable. I was lying when I said life was uncontrollable, and I was lying when I said it was unpredictable. Sure, you can't control everything all by yourself, but the amount of effort a human being can put into it, could just make a small change. These changes could create domino effects, and change the world entirely. If you have a plan, you can do it. So, what's your plan? Do you wanna hear the punchline, or would you rather scroll on with your day on the internet?

It's entirely up to you. You can stop reading if you want, or you can go on.

We can all go on.

Not wanting to go to sleep right away, Ms. White stays up a little longer just to check if anyone else would come along.  Sure enough, about ten minutes later, another knock on the door.

212,“Knock Knock”,18,0.95,"“so sorry to keep you waiting!"" he was going to say, when he saw that it was not Gandalf at all. It was a dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt, and very bright eyes under his dark-green hood. As soon a the door was opened, he pushed inside, just as if he had been expected. He hung his hooded cloak on the nearest peg, and ""Dwalin at your service!"" he said with a low bow.

""Bilbo Baggins at yours!"" said the hobbit, too surprised to ask any questions for the moment. When the silence that followed had become uncomfortable, he added: ""I am just about to take tea; pray come and have some with me."" A little stiff perhaps, but he meant it kindly. And what would you do, if an uninvited dwarf came and hung his things up in your hall without a word of explanation?

They had not been at table long, in fact they had hardly reached the third cake, when there came another even louder ring at the bell. ""Excuse me!"" said the hobbit, and off he went to the door. ""So you have got here at last!"" was what he was going to say to Gandalf this time. But it was not Gandalf. Instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood; and he too hopped inside as soon as the door was open, just as if he had been invited. ""I see they have begun to arrive already,"" he said when he caught sight of Dwalin's green hood hanging up. He hung his red one next to it, and ""Balin at your service!"" he said with his hand on his breast.

""Thank you!"" said Bilbo with a gasp. It was not the correct thing to say, but they have begun to arrive had flustered him badly. He liked visitors, but he liked to know them before they arrived, and he preferred to ask them himself. He had a horrible thought that the cakes might run short, and then he-as the host: he knew his duty and stuck to it however painful-he might have to go without.


""Come along in, and have some tea!"" he managed to say after taking a deep breath.

""A little beer would suit me better, if it is all the same to you, my good sir,"" said Balin with the white beard. ""But I don't mind some cake-seed-cake, if you have any.""

""Lots!"" Bilbo found himself answering, to his own surprise; and he found himself scuttling off, too, to the cellar to fill a pint beer-mug, and to the pantry to fetch two beautiful round seed-cakes which he had baked that afternoon for his after-supper morsel.

When he got back Balin and Dwalin were talking at the table like old friends (as a matter of fact they were brothers). Bilbo plumped down the beer and the cake in front of them, when loud came a ring at the bell again, and then another ring.

""Gandalf for certain this time,"" he thought as he puffed along the passage. But it was not. It was two more dwarves, both with blue hoods, silver belts, and yellow beards; and each of them carried a bag of tools and a spade. In they hopped, as soon as the door began to open-Bilbo was hardly surprised at all.

""What can I do for you, my dwarves?"" he said. ""Kili at your service!""

said the one. ""And Fili!"" added the other; and they both swept off their blue hoods and bowed.

""At yours and your family's!"" replied Bilbo, remembering his manners this time.

""Dwalin and Balin here already, I see,"" said Kili. ""Let us join the throng!""

""Throng!"" thought Mr. Baggins. ""I don't like the sound of that. I really must sit down for a minute and collect my wits, and have a drink."" He had only just had a sip-in the corner, while the four dwarves sat around the table, and talked about mines and gold and troubles with the goblins, and the depredations of dragons, and lots of other things which he did not understand, and did not want to, for they sounded much too adventurous-when, ding-dong-a-ling-' dang, his bell rang again, as if some naughty little hobbit-boy was trying to pull the handle off. ""Someone at the door!"" he said, blinking. ""Some four, I should say by the sound,"" said Fili. ""Be-sides, we saw them coming along behind us in the distance.""

The poor little hobbit sat down in the hall and put his head in his hands, and wondered what had happened, and what was going to happen, and whether they would all stay to supper. Then the bell rang again louder than ever, and he had to run to the door. It was not four after all, it was FIVE. Another dwarf had come along while he was wondering in the hall. He had hardly turned the knob, be-x)re they were all inside, bowing and saying ""at your service"" one after another. Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, and Gloin were their names; and very soon two purple hoods, a grey hood, a brown hood, and a white hood were hanging on the pegs, and off they marched with their broad hands stuck in their gold and silver belts to join the others. Already it had almost become a throng. Some called for ale, and some for porter, and one for coffee, and all of them for cakes; so the hobbit was kept very busy for a while. A big jug of coffee bad just been set in the hearth, the seed-cakes were gone, and the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones, when there came-a loud knock. Not a ring, but a hard rat-tat on the hobbit's beautiful green door. Somebody was banging with a stick!

Bilbo rushed along the passage, very angry, and altogether bewildered and bewuthered-this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered. He pulled open the door with a jerk, and they all fell in, one on top of the other. More dwarves, four more! And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before. ""Carefully! Carefully!"" he said. ""It is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!"" ""At your service!"" said Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur standing in a row. Then they hung up two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long silver tassel. This last belonged to Thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than the great Thorin Oakenshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling flat on Bilbo's mat with Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur on top of him. For one thing Bombur was immensely fat and heavy. Thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor Mr. Baggins said he was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted ""pray don't mention it,"" and stopped frowning.

""Now we are all here!"" said Gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods-the best detachable party hoods-and his own hat hanging on the pegs. ""Quite a merry gathering!

I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat and drink! What's that? Tea! No thank you! A little red wine, I think, for me."" ""And for me,"" said Thorin. ""And raspberry jam and apple-tart,"" said Bifur. ""And mince-pies and cheese,"" said Bofur. ""And pork-pie and salad,"" said Bombur. ""And more cakes-and ale-and coffee, if you don't mind,"" called the other dwarves through the door.

""Put on a few eggs, there's a good fellow!"" Gandalf called after him, as

the hobbit stumped off to the pantries. ""And just bring out the cold chicken and pickles!""

""Seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself!"" thought Mr. Baggins, who was feeling positively flummoxed, and was beginning to wonder whether a most wretched adventure had not come right into his house. By the time he had got all the bottles and dishes and knives and forks and glasses and plates and spoons and things piled up on big trays, he was getting very hot, and red in the face, and annoyed.

""Confusticate and bebother these dwarves!"" he said aloud. ""Why don't they come and lend a hand?"" Lo and behold! there stood Balin and Dwalin at the door of the kitchen, and Fili and Kili behind them, and before he could say knife they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour and set out everything afresh.

Gandalf sat at the head of the party with the thirteen, dwarves all round: and Bilbo sat on a stool at the fireside, nibbling at a biscuit (his appetite was quite taken away), and trying to look as if this was all perfectly ordinary and. not in the least an adventure. The dwarves ate and ate, and talked and talked, and time got on. At last they pushed their chairs back, and Bilbo made a move to collect the plates and glasses. ""I suppose you will all stay to supper?"" he said in his politest unpressing tones. ""Of course!"" said Thorin. ""And after. We shan't get through the business till late, and we must have some music first. Now to clear up!"" Thereupon the twelve dwarves-not Thorin, he was too important, and stayed talking to Gandalf-jumped to their feet and made tall piles of all the things. Off they went, not waiting for trays, balancing columns of plates, each with a bottle on the top, with one hand, while the hobbit ran after them almost squeaking with fright: ""please be careful!"" and ""please, don't trouble! I can manage."" But the dwarves only started to sing:

""Chip the glasses and crack the plates!
Blunt the knives and bend the forks!
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates-
Smash the bottles and burn the corks!
Cut the cloth and tread on the fat!
Pour the milk on the pantry floor!
Leave the bones on the bedroom mat!
Splash the wine on every door!
Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl;
Pound them up with a thumping pole;
And when you've finished, if any are whole,
Send them down the hall to roll!
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!
So, carefully! carefully with the plates!""

And of course they did none of these dreadful things, and everything was cleaned and put away safe as quick as lightning, while the hobbit was turning round and round in the middle of the kitchen trying to see what they were doing. Then they went back, and found Thorin with his feet on the fender smoking a pipe. He was blowing the most enormous smoke-rings, and wherever he told one to go, it went-up the chimney, or behind the clock on the man-telpiece, or under the table, or round and round the ceiling; but wherever it went it was not quick enough to escape Gandalf. Pop! he sent a smaller smoke-ring from his short clay-pipe straight through each one of Thorin's. The Gandalf's smoke-ring would go green and come back to hover over the wizard's head. He had quite a cloud of them about him already, and in the dim light it made him look strange and sorcerous. Bilbo stood still and watched-he loved smoke-rings-and then be blushed to think how proud he had been yesterday morning of the smoke-rings he had sent up the wind over The Hill. ""Now for some music!"" said Thorin. ""Bring out the instruments!""

Kili and Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles;

Dori, Nori, and Ori brought out flutes from somewhere inside their coats; Bombur produced a drum from the hall; Bifur and Bofur went out too, and came back with clarinets that they had left among the walking-sticks Dwalin and Balin said: ""Excuse me, I left mine in the porch!"" ""Just bring mine in with you,"" said Thorin. They came back with viols as big as themselves, and with Thorin's harp wrapped in a green cloth. It was a beautiful gold-en harp, and when Thorin struck it the music began all at once, so sudden and sweet that Bilbo forgot everything else, and was swept away into dark lands under strange moons, far over The Water and very far from his hobbit-hole under The Hill. The dark came into the room from the little window that opened in the side of The Hill; the firelight flickered-it was April-and still they played on, while the shadow of Gandalf's beard wagged against the wall. The dark filled all the room, and the fire died down, and the shadows were lost, and still they played on. And suddenly first one and then another began to sing as they played, deep-throated singing of the dwarves in the deep places of their ancient homes; and this is like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their song without their music.

""Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away ere break of day
To seek the pale enchanted gold.

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
While hammers fell like ringing bells
In places deep, where dark things sleep,
In hollow halls beneath the fells.

For ancient king and elvish lord
There many a gloaming golden hoard
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

On silver necklaces they strung
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
The dragon-fire, in twisted wire
They meshed the light of moon and sun.

Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day,
To claim our long-forgotten gold.

Goblets they carved there for themselves
And harps of gold; where no man delves
There lay they long, and many a song
Was sung unheard by men or elves.

The pines were roaring on the height,
The winds were moaning in the night.
The fire was red, it flaming spread;
The trees like torches biased with light,

The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale;
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire
Laid low their towers and houses frail.

The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.
They fled their hall to dying fall
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.

Far over the misty mountains grim
To dungeons deep and caverns dim
We must away, ere break of day,
To win our harps and gold from him!""

As they sang the hobbit felt the love of beautiful things made by hands and by cunning and by magic moving through him, a fierce and jealous love, the desire of the hearts of dwarves. Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick. He looked out of the window. The stars were out in a dark sky above the trees. He thought of the jewels of the dwarves shining in dark caverns. Suddenly in the wood beyond The Water a flame leapt up - probably somebody lighting a wood-fire-and he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames. He shuddered; and very quickly he was plain Mr. Baggins of Bag-End, Under-Hill, again. He got up trembling. He had less than half a mind to fetch the lamp, and more than half a mind to pretend to, and go and hide behind the beer barrels in the cellar, and not come out again until all the dwarves had gone away. Suddenly he found that the music and the singing had stopped, and they were all looking at him with eyes shining in the dark.

""Where are you going?"" said Thorin, in a tone that seemed to show that he guessed both halves of the hobbit's mind.

""What about a little light?"" said Bilbo apologetically.

""We like the dark,"" said the dwarves. ""Dark for dark business! There are many hours before dawn.""

""Of course!"" said Bilbo, and sat down in a hurry. He missed the stool and sat in the fender, knocking over the poker and shovel with a crash. ""Hush!"" said Gandalf. ""Let Thorin speak!"" And this is bow Thorin began. ""Gandalf, dwarves and Mr. Baggins! We are not together in the house of our friend and fellow conspirator, this most excellent and audacious hobbit-may the hair on his toes never fall out! all praise to his wine and ale!-"" He paused for breath and for a polite remark from the hob-bit, but the compliments were quite lost on-poor Bilbo Baggins, who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called audacious and worst of all fellow conspirator, though no noise came out, he was so flummoxed. So Thorin went on:

""We are met to discuss our plans, our ways, means, policy and devices. We shall soon before the break of day start on our long journey, a journey from which some of us, or perhaps all of us (except our friend and counsellor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf) may never return. It is a solemn moment. Our object is, I take it, well known to us all. To the estimable Mr. Baggins, and perhaps to one or two of the younger dwarves (I think I should be right in naming Kili and Fili, for instance), the exact situation at the moment may require a little brief explanation-"" This was Thorin's style. He was an important dwarf. If he had been allowed, he would probably have gone on like this until he was out of breath, without telling any one there 'anything that was not known already. But he was rudely interrupted. Poor Bilbo couldn't bear it any longer. At may never return he began to feel a shriek coming up inside, and very soon it burst out like the whistle of an engine coming out of a tunnel. All the dwarves sprang Bp knocking over the table. Gandalf struck a blue light on the end of his magic staff, and in its firework glare the poor little hobbit could be seen kneeling on the hearth-rug, shaking like a jelly that was melting. Then he fell flat on the floor, and kept on calling out ""struck by lightning, struck by lightning!"" over and over again; and that was all they could get out of him for a long time. So they took him and laid him out of the way on the drawing-room sofa with a drink at his elbow, and they went back to their dark business.

""Excitable little fellow,"" said Gandalf, as they sat down again. ""Gets funny queer fits, but he is one of the best, one of the best-as fierce as a dragon in a pinch.""

If you have ever seen a dragon in a pinch, you will realise that this was only poetical exaggeration applied to any hobbit, even to Old Took's great-granduncle Bullroarer, who was so huge (for a hobbit) that he could ride a horse. He charged the ranks of the goblins of Mount Gram in the Battle of the Green Fields, and knocked their king Gol-firnbul's head clean off with a wooden club. It sailed a hundred yards through the air and went down a rabbit hole, and in this way the battle was won and the game of Golf invented at the same moment.

In the meanwhile, however, Bullroarer's gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-room. After a while and a drink he crept nervously to the door of the parlour. This is what he heard, Gloin speaking: ""Humph!"" (or some snort more or less like that). ""Will he do, do you think? It is all very well for Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce, but one shriek like that in a moment of excitement would be enough to wake the dragon and all his relatives, and kill the lot of us. I think it sounded more like fright than excitement! In fact, if it bad not been for the sign on the door, I should have been sure we had come to the wrong house. As soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat, I had my doubts. He looks more like a grocer-than a burglar!""

Then Mr. Baggins turned the handle and went in. The Took side had won. He suddenly felt he would go without bed and breakfast to be thought fierce. As for little fellow bobbing on the mat it almost made him really fierce. Many a time afterwards the Baggins part regretted what he did now, and he said to himself: ""Bilbo, you were a fool; you walked right in and put your foot in it.""

""Pardon me,"" he said, ""if I have overheard words that you were saying. I don't pretend to understand what you are talking about, or your reference to burglars, but I think I am right in believing"" (this is what he called being on his dignity) ""that you think I am no good. I will show you. I have no signs on my door-it was painted a week ago-, and I am quite sure you have come to the wrong house. As soon as I saw your funny faces on the door-step, I had my doubts. But treat it as the right one. Tell me what you want done, and I will try it, if I have to walk from here to the East of East and fight the wild Were-worms in the Last Desert. I bad a great-great-great-granduncle once, Bullroarer Took, and -"" ""Yes, yes, but that was long ago,"" said Gloin. ""I was talking about you. And I assure you there is a mark on this door-the usual one in the trade, or used to be. Burglar wants a good job, plenty of Excitement and reasonable Reward, that's how it is usually read. You ^an say Expert Treasure-hunter instead of Burglar if you like. Some of them do. It's all the same to us. Gandalf told us that there was a man of the sort in these parts looking for a Job at once, and that he had arranged for a meeting here this Wednesday tea-time.""

""Of course there is a mark,"" said Gandalf. ""I put it there myself. For very good reasons. You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins. Just let any one say I chose the wrong man or the wrong house, and you can stop at thirteen and have all the bad luck you like, or go back to digging coal.""

He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair; and when Bilbo tried to open his mouth to ask a question, he turned and frowned at him and stuck oat his bushy eyebrows, till Bilbo shut his mouth tight with a snap. ""That's right,"" said Gandalf. ""Let's have no more argument. I have chosen Mr. Baggins and that ought to !6te enough for all of you. If I say he is a Burglar, a Burglar he is, or will be when the time comes. There is a lot more in him than you guess, and a deal more than he has any idea of himself. You may (possibly) all live to thank me yet. Now Bilbo, my boy, fetch the lamp, and let's have little light on this!""

On the table in the light of a big lamp with a red shad he spread a piece of parchment rather like a map.

""This was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin, he said in answer to the dwarves' excited questions. ""It is a plan of the Mountain."" ""I don't see that this will help us much,"" said Thorin disappointedly after a glance. ""I remember the Mountain well enough and the lands about it. And I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred.""

""There is a dragon marked in red on the Mountain, said Balin, ""but it will be easy enough to find him without that, if ever we arrive there."" ""There is one point that you haven't noticed,"" said the wizard, ""and that is the secret entrance. You see that rune on the West side, and the hand pointing to it from the other runes? That marks a hidden passage to the Lower Halls.

""It may have been secret once,"" said Thorin, ""but how do we know that it is secret any longer? Old Smaug had lived there long enough now to find out anything there is to know about those caves.""

""He may-but he can't have used it for years and years. ""Why?"" ""Because it is too small. 'Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast' say the runes, but Smaug could not creep into a hole that size, not even when he was a young dragon, certainly not after devouring so many of the dwarves and men of Dale.""

""It seems a great big hole to me,"" squeaked Bilbo (who had no experience of dragons and only of hobbit-holes) He was getting excited and interested again, so that he forgot to keep his mouth shut. He loved maps, and in his hall there hung a large one of the Country Round with all his favourite walks marked on it in red ink. ""How could such a large door be kept secret from everybody outside, apart from the dragon?"" he asked. He was only a little hobbit you must remember.

""In lots of ways,"" said Gandalf. ""But in what way this one has been hidden we don't know without going to see. From what it says on the map I should guess there is a closed door which has been made to look exactly like the side of the Mountain. That is the usual dwarves' method - I think that is right, isn't it?"" ""Quite right,"" said Thorin.

""Also,"" went on Gandalf, ""I forgot to mention that with the map went a key, a small and curious key. Here it is!"" he said, and handed to Thorin a key with a long barrel and intricate wards, made of silver. ""Keep it safe!"" ""Indeed I will,"" said Thorin, and he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck and under his jacket. ""Now things begin to look more hopeful. This news alters them much for-the better. So far we have had no clear idea what to do. We thought of going East, as quiet and careful as we could, as far as the Long Lake. After that the trouble would begin."" ""A long time before that, if I know anything about the loads East,"" interrupted Gandalf.

""We might go from there up along the River Running,"" went on Thorin taking no notice, ""and so to the ruins of Dale-the old town in the valley there, under the shadow of the Mountain. But we none of us liked the idea of the Front Gate. The river runs right out of it through the great cliff at the South of the Mountain, and out of it comes the dragon too-far too often, unless he has changed.""

""That would be no good,"" said the wizard, ""not without a mighty Warrior, even a Hero. I tried to find one; but warriors are busy fighting one another in distant lands, and in this neighbourhood heroes are scarce, or simply lot to be found. Swords in these parts are mostly blunt, and axes are used for trees, and shields as cradles or dish-covers; and dragons are comfortably far-off (and therefore legendary). That is why I settled on burglary-especially when I remembered the existence of a Side-door. And here is our little Bilbo Baggins, the burglar, the chosen and selected burglar. So now let's get on and make some plans.""

""Very well then,"" said Thorin, ""supposing the burglar-expert gives us some ideas or suggestions."" He turned with mock-politeness to Bilbo. ""First I should like to know a bit more about things,"" said he, feeling all confused and a bit shaky inside, but so far still lookishly determined to go on with things. ""I mean about the gold and the dragon, and all that, and how it got there, and who it belongs to, and so on and further."" ""Bless me!"" said Thorin, ""haven't you got a map? and didn't you hear our song? and haven't we been talking about all this for hours?""

""All the same, I should like it all plain and clear,"" said he

obstinately, putting on his business manner (usually reserved for people who tried to borrow money off him), and doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to Gandalf's recommendation. ""Also I should like to know about risks, out-of-pocket expenses, time required and remuneration, and so forth""-by which he meant: ""What am I going to get out of it? and am I going to come back alive?""

""O very well,"" said Thorin. ""Long ago in my grandfather Thror's time our family was driven out of the far North, and came back with all their wealth and their tools to this Mountain on the map. It had been discovered by my far ancestor, Thrain the Old, but now they mined and they tunnelled and they made huger halls and greater workshops -and in addition I believe they found a good deal of gold and a great many jewels too. Anyway they grew immensely rich and famous, and my grandfather was King under the Mountain again and treated with great reverence by the mortal men, who lived to the South, and were gradually spreading up the Running River as far as the valley overshadowed by the Mountain. They built the merry town of Dale there in those days. Kings used to send for our smiths, and reward even the least skilful most richly. Fathers would beg us to take their sons as apprentices, and pay us handsomely, especially in food-supplies, which we never bothered to grow or find for ourselves. Altogether those were good days for us, and the poorest of us had money to spend and to lend, and leisure to make beautiful things just for the. fun of it, not to speak of the most marvellous and magical toys, the like of which is not to be found in the world now-a-days. So my grandfather's halls became full of armour and jewels and carvings and cups, and the toy-market of Dale was the wonder of the North.

""Undoubtedly that was what brought the dragon. Dragons steal gold and jewels, you know, from men and elves and dwarves, wherever they can find them; and they guard their plunder as long as they live (which is practically forever, unless they are killed), and never enjoy a brass ring of it. Indeed they hardly know a good bit of work from a bad, though they usually have a good notion of the current market value; and they can't make a thing for themselves, not even mend a little loose scale of their armour. There were lots of dragons in the North in those days, and gold was probably getting scarce up there, with the dwarves flying south or getting killed, and all the general waste and destruction that dragons make going from bad to worse. There was a most specially greedy, strong and wicked worm called Smaug. One day he flew up into the air and came south. The first we heard of it was a noise like a hurricane coming from the North, and the pine-trees on the Mountain creaking and cracking in the wind. Some of the dwarves who happened to be outside (I was one luckily -a fine adventurous lad in those days, always wandering about, and it saved my life that day)-well, from a good way off we saw the dragon settle on our mountain in a spout of flame. Then he came down the slopes and when he reached the woods they all went up in fire. By that time all the bells were ringing in Dale and the warriors were arming. The dwarves rushed out of their great gate; but there was the dragon waiting for them. None escaped that way. The river rushed up in steam and a fog fell on Dale, and in the fog the dragon came on them and destroyed most of the warriors-the usual unhappy story, it was only too common in those days. Then he went back and crept in through the Front Gate and routed out all the halls, and lanes, and tunnels, alleys, cellars, mansions and passages. After that there were no dwarves left alive inside, and he took all their wealth for himself. Probably, for that is the dragons' way, he has piled it all up in a great heap far inside, and sleeps on it for a bed. Later he used to crawl out of the great gate and come by night to Dale, and carry away people, especially maidens, to eat, until Dale was ruined, and all the people dead or gone. What goes on there now I don't know for certain, but I don't suppose anyone lives nearer to the Mountain than the far edge of the Long Lake now-a-days.

""The few of us that were well outside sat and wept in hiding, and cursed Smaug; and there we were unexpectedly joined by my father and my grandfather with singed beards. They looked very grim but they said very little. When I asked how they had got away, they told me to hold my tongue, and said that one day in the proper time I should know. After that we went away, and we have had to earn our livings as best we could up and down the lands, often enough sinking as low as blacksmith-work or even coalmining. But we have never forgotten our stolen treasure. And even now, when I will allow we have a good bit laid by and are not so badly off""-here Thorin stroked the gold chain round his neck-""we still mean to get it back, and to bring our curses home to Smaug-if we can.

""I have often wondered about my father's and my grandfather's escape. I see now they must have had a private Side-door which only they knew about. But apparently they made a map, and I should like to know how Gandalf got hold of it, and why it did not come down to me, the rightful heir."" ""I did not 'get hold of it,' I was given it,"" said the wizard. ""Your grandfather Thror was killed, you remember, in the mines of Moria by Azog the Goblin -"" ""Curse his name, yes,"" said Thorin.

""And Thrain your father went away on the twenty-first of April, a hundred years ago last Thursday, and has never been seen by you since-"" ""True, true,"" said Thorin.

""Well, your father gave me this to give to you; and if I have chosen my own time and way of handing it over, you can hardly blame me, considering the trouble I had to find you. Your father could not remember his own name when he gave me the paper, and he never told me yours; so on the whole I think I ought to be praised and thanked. Here it is,"" said he handing the map to Thorin. ""I don't understand,"" said Thorin, and Bilbo felt he would have liked to say the same. The explanation did not seem to explain. ""Your grandfather,"" said the wizard slowly and grimly, ""gave the map to his son for safety before he went to the mines of Moria. Your father went away to try his luck with the map after your grandfather was killed; and lots of adventures of a most unpleasant sort he had, but he never got near the Mountain. How he got there I don't know, but I found him a prisoner in the dungeons of the Necromancer.""

""Whatever were you doing there?"" asked Thorin with a shudder, and all the dwarves shivered.

""Never you mind. I was finding things out, as usual; and a nasty dangerous business it was. Even I, Gandalf, only just escaped. I tried to save your father, but it was too late. He was witless and wandering, and had forgotten almost everything except the map and the key."" ""We have long ago paid the goblins of Moria,"" said Thorin; ""we must give a thought to the Necromancer."" ""Don't be absurd! He is an enemy quite beyond the powers of all the dwarves put together, if they could all be collected again from the four corners of the world. The one thing your father wished was for his son to read the map and use the key. The dragon and the Mountain are more than big enough tasks for you!""

""Hear, hear!"" said Bilbo, and accidentally said it aloud, ""Hear what?"" they all said turning suddenly towards him, and he was so flustered that he answered ""Hear what I have got to say!"" ""What's that?"" they asked. ""Well, I should say that you ought to go East and have a look round.

After all there is the Side-door, and dragons must sleep sometimes, I suppose.

If you sit on the doorstep long enough, I daresay you will think of something. And well, don't you know, I think we have talked long enough for one night, if you see what I mean. What about bed, and an early start, and all that? I will give you a good breakfast before you go.""

""Before we go, I suppose you mean,"" said Thorin. ""Aren't you the burglar? And isn't sitting on the door-step your job, not to speak of getting inside the door? But I agree about bed and breakfast. I like eggs with my ham, when starting on a journey: fried not poached, and mind you don't break 'em.""

After all the others had ordered their breakfasts without so much as a please (which annoyed Bilbo very much), they all got up. The hobbit had to find room for them all, and filled all his spare-rooms and made beds on chairs and sofas, before he got them all stowed and went to his own little bed very tired and not altogether happy. One thing he did make his mind up about was not to bother to get up very early and cook everybody else's wretched breakfast. The Tookishness was wearing off, and he was not now quite so sure that he was going on any journey in the morning. As he lay in bed he could hear Thorin still humming to himself in the best bedroom next to him:

""Far over the misty mountains cold
To dungeons deep and caverns old
We must away, ere break of day,
To find our long-forgotten gold.""

Bilbo went to sleep with that in his ears, and it gave him very uncomfortable dreams. It was long after the break of day, when he woke up.",3,False,False,4

291,Why did Oscar the flaming and flamboyant homosexual man express that he could never consider a woman’s ‘axe wound’ as something he could ever take pleasure in?,8,1.0,"Well when Oscar was 4 years old he witnessed his abusive psychopathic father lodge an axe into his mother’s abdomen and ever since that moment he has never taken pleasure in seeing an axe wound in a woman. To be honest he probably wouldn’t have ever found it appealing even if he hadn’t been traumatised. After his mothers death from bleeding out and his fathers imprisonment Oscar was placed in a foster home - and was eventually adopted, but unfortunately he was old enough to remember the brutal act of his father chopping into his mother with an axe. He has been attending trauma Councilling for years which sadly rarely ever helped his severe PTSD, in fact he has been diagnosed with an array of other mental health conditions common to a man that experienced a trauma during childhood. With the help of years of therapy, medication and finding the love of his life (Bernard) he is finally able to start talking about his traumatic experience which is why he has been stating openly that he could never take pleasure in a woman’s axe wound. Frankly he couldn’t take pleasure in seeing an axe wound regardless if it was inflicted on a male or a female. But he is coming to terms with the fact that the axe wound that was lodged into his *mother’s* abdomen, a woman, which was also lodged into his psyche. He is trying a new technique while working with his therapist of talking openly about his trauma to Bernard in a casual way so as to defuse the notion that his abhorrent aversion to his memory of his mother’s axe wound that eventually killed her is now no more than a statement that ‘that’s not something I could ever take pleasure in’.... this alludes to the fact that Oscars father perhaps took pleasure in using an axe on his wife, but that’s something that oscars therapist hopes to address in the future. For now, oscars therapist is glad that he’s talking candidly about his mother’s ‘axe wound’ because it’s a step away from denial and instead a turn towards acceptance.",0,False,False,4

418,A man walks into a bar...,14,0.86,"... he says ""Ow.""

The thing is, he knows that the old pull-up bar is hanging on the frame to the basement door. It's been there for years. But he... forgot it, somehow? Didn't duck, went full speed right into it, forehead first. There's a ringing in his ears, the vision in his left eye blurring. ""Just rung my bell again."" 

The memory problems started about ten years ago. It didn't make sense - he was only in his thirties. There was no history of mental weakness in his family, yet here he was, forgetting why he left the house, forgetting anniversaries. Judith! Right, Judy could help him get back up the stairs. ""Honey, I'm feeling a little dizzy here..."" 

No answer came, of course. She left him three years ago. She tried, good lord she tried so hard. But the mood swings and night terrors and uncharacteristic, unpredictable violent rages were too much. The man she loved was being hallowed out before her eyes, lost atom by atom to coalescing black holes of degenerating grey matter.

The pain of his loneliness came rushing back into him, as if anew, but probably for the hundredth time. The pain in his head was now joined by one in his heart. She left him just like they all left him. The doctors and their lies. ""CTE my ass.""

He was an athlete! Playing the O-Line was relatively anonymous, but his peers knew him well. He had raw power tempered by affability, a gentle giant of good humor and greater football IQ. His job was to be a tank, absorb the hits, which he did with ease. There were dozens of concussions he knew about - often shrugged off after the impartial medical advice of coaches who would assure him that he just ""rung his bell."" There were uncountable subconcussive hits. He endured the bloodsport for twenty years, with nothing left to show for it but chronic traumatic encephalopathy. 

The money is gone, family and friends are gone, memory is gone, health is gone. But he's got the bottle, thank god he's got the bottle. Judith tried to get him to stop, the doctors all said it wasn't helping, but what the fuck do they know?! Alcohol is the only thing helping right now. 

Ach, the gin. That's why he came downstairs. He can't stand gin, but he's out of everything else and the credit cards are frozen. He turns around to go back down, muttering that Judith should just go to the liquor store. Maybe he didn't see it, maybe he forgot:

454,A horse walks into a bar,15,0.94,"A horse walks into a bar and the bartender asks, “why the long face?”

The horse says, ""hypothetically, imagine that through whatever course of human evolution, for some reason when men ejaculate, entire babies are shot out. Let's also imagine that these babies need to be placed in a woman in order to germinate completely, so this doesn't change the overall process of having a child at all. In fact, these babies are quite small, maybe only a tablespoon in volume. Only one can come out in any given session unless you've been edging for a while or are more pent up than usual. They swim up the fallopian tubes as sperm would, and the woman's body knows how to plug them into their uterine lining somehow. The babies cannot survive on their own outside of a womb for much more than, say, five minutes. In those five minutes, they are much like fish out of water. Flopping about, doing the only thing their as of yet undeveloped neural systems know how to do: trying to swim up. Eventually, they die, and you're left with a grape-sized humanoid smeared on whatever sheet, or sock, or person’s back you're partial to leaving such things on. 

""In such a world, would abortion be more, or less accepted? On the one hand, we have complete proof that these fetuses have some sort of mental capacity. They are capable of surviving, at least for a short time, and can react to stimuli. They can even make moderately intelligent choices in order to navigate their way through the female anatomy, otherwise, they would 'get lost' and the human species would promptly become sterile. Following this thread, it seems like we would be less likely to allow abortions. With the image of someone literally shooting a baby into someone, it seems humans, in general, would decide that there is enough sapience there that we couldn't kill it. It seems in this scenario that paradoxically life begins before conception. Being kicked in the balls would near genocide, the equivalent of kicking a satchel full of children with a steel-toed boot.

""On the other hand, it may be that we get entirely jaded to the idea of abortion. Every adolescent male would have had to kill thousands upon thousands of fetuses before they turned twenty! The experience of having a wet dream would be even more disturbing, as instead of waking up to a mild stickiness in your sheets, you wake up snuggled up to the corpse of a child. Imagine walking to your child's door, and without warning, you enter his room. Find him hastily hiding the smashed pulp of a fetus he just had to euthanize would be no different than the snapping shut of a laptop now. It almost seems like in this universe we would justify abortions more easily, as all the world's men--who seem to be the biggest proponents of the pro-life argument--would have spent their adolescence performing abortions on themselves every day. 

""The argument could certainly be made that if a grape-sized child came out of you every time you took yourself on a j-date maybe people would take the Catholic church's rules about ""spilling your seed"" a little more seriously, but I think the level of horniness in teenage boys would still outweigh any misguided or otherwise moral compass on masturbation. And what else can they do afterward? It's more cruel not to snap your semen's little spine. Otherwise, it's just going to die from exposure! This is more or less how it is in our universe. Every time one ejaculates, in a way, millions upon millions of potential human lives die of exposure to the hostile elements. The only real difference is they are smaller and look less humanoid. 

""Porn would also take an interesting turn. I'm curious if something like bukkake would still have a place in this universe. Would people still want to watch a woman swallow? Would the bisexual women involved in threesomes kiss a more and more mangled, chewed up baby back and forth only for both of them to swallow pieces of it? How would anal sex work? What happens if you don't pull out, and a baby is just lodged in your large intestine? How much would these babies be fetishized in general? It seems that nearly everything, fluid or excretion related, sexual or not, has a community dedicated to the fetishization of it. If we live in a world with foot fetishists, and individuals obsessed with water or bloodplay, it's harder to believe people wouldn't be into sexualizing their undercooked baby excrement.

""The issue of premature ejaculation is another interesting one in this universe. Imagine being on a date with a cute girl, things are going well, she keeps touching your arms and thighs when she laughs. Long story short, there’s a lot of stimulation going on. Finally, you’re back in her apartment under the pretense of getting some 1 AM coffee (which is a tradition I don’t really understand. Sex or not, do people really want to be drinking coffee that late? That’s just irresponsible). You guys are kissing and cuddling, tongues are moving around--look, this isn't my personal erotica, you can fill in the gaps. One thing leads to another, and you tense up. All of a sudden you and this poor, poor girl look down. She was alerted by a sudden sensation of frantic movement coming from your crotch. The bulge that was there has been replaced with a softer, smaller one, and a bulge that’s flopping around as if you had a water balloon containing a goldfish strapped to your leg, and it suddenly popped. In this universe, you both know what’s just occurred. Instead of terror because there’s a tiny creature (hell, maybe two or three, she was pretty hot) swimming down your pant-leg, you feel embarrassed that you let it out this early. If you try again before a few hours have passed, you’ll just shoot out an arm or a leg, which sucks because unbeknownst to you, this girl is particularly into baby-play. Too bad.

The local Sheriff was looking for a new deputy. When a blonde walks in to try for the job, he asks her,

“What is 1 and 1?”

“Eleven”, she replies.

The Sheriff thinks to himself, “That’s not what I wanted, but I guess she’s right!”

“What are the two days of the week wich begin with the letter T?” he asks.

“Today and Tomorrow”, the blonde answers.

The Sheriff is surprised again that the blonde has supplied a correct answer that had not even occurred to him.

“Now listen carefully, who killed Abe Lincoln?” he asks her. The blonde looks a little surprised. She thinks really hard for a minute and finally admits,

“I don’t know.”

“Well, why don’t you go home and work on that one for a while?”

So, the blonde wanders over to the beauty parlor, where her pals are waiting to hear the results of the interview. The blonde was exultant.

“The interview went great!” she says. “The first day on the job and I’m already working on a murder case!”

593,Power Of Attorney – Super-Funny,3,0.8," The madam opened the brothel door to see a rather dignified, well-dressed good looking man in his late 40s or early 50s.

“May I help you?” she asked.

“I want to see Karen,” the man replied.

“Sir, Karen is one of our most expensive ladies. Perhaps you would prefer someone else,” said the madam.

“No. I must see Karen,” was the man’s reply.

Just then, Karen appeared and announced to the man that she charged 1,000 dollars a visit. Without hesitation, the man pulled out ten one-hundred-dollar bills, gave them to Karen, and they went upstairs. After an hour, the man calmly left.

The next night, the same man appeared again, demanding to see Karen. Karen explained that none had ever come back two nights in a row – too expensive – and there were no discounts. The price was still 1,000 dollars. Again the man pulled out the money, gave it to Karen and they went upstairs. After an hour, he left.

The following night the man was there again. Everyone was astounded that he had come for the third consecutive night, but he paid Karen and they went upstairs. After their session, Karen questioned the man.

“No one has ever been with me three nights in a row. Where are you from?” she asked.

The man replied, “New Jersey.”

“Really,” she said. “I have family in New Jersey.”

“I know,” the man said. “Your father died, and I am your sister’s attorney. She asked me to give you your [3,000 dollars inheritance.”](https://www.super-funny.com/in/reddit/antijokes/funny_stories/power-of-attorney/)",0,False,False,4

Out of curiosity he rubs the lamp and from the tip of the lamp exits a powerful and mystical genie. He bellows ""I am the genie of the lamp! As you have freed me from my prison, I will grant you three wishes!"" The man carefully considers his options. He decides that he should wish himself back to safety as his third wish, for if he does so immediately he may lose the lamp and forfeit his other two. 

He commands the genie: ""I wish that I were the richest man in the world!"" 

The genie snaps his fingers and replies ""Done! When you return to your home, you will find that half of the world's wealth belongs to you!""

The man, eager to keep his good fortune going, says ""I also wish that I were king of the world!""

The genie again snaps his fingers and booms ""As you wish! From now on, every nation and tribe will bow to your rule!""

The man, giddy with excitement, exclaims ""Incredible! I'm the most powerful person that ever lived! Who would have thought that I would not only make something of myself but become the single most important figure of all time? My parents would realize they were all wrong about me if they were still around. I wish I could see the look on their stupid faces.""

The genie, knowing the man may have been unaware that the phrasing of his monologue would expend his final wish, asks him ""This is your third and final wish. Is this your final answer?""

The man, realizing how close he was to wasting his last wish and dying in the cave, proclaims ""Of course not, how foolish of me! I wish to be transported from this cave to my home with my injuries healed""

849,Why was 6 afraid of 7?,39,0.9,"6 wasn't afraid of 7. 7 wasn't afraid of 6. They're numbers, they're not sentient, they're not even alive. Numbers can't fear, cry, smile, or care. Humans personalize these numbers for the burst of dopamine in their empty lives called humor, and if you really want this humor, take it.

Life will go on, while these numbers can't feel, we can! We deserve this happiness in our lives, there's nothing wrong with it, all it is is a few simple words to make someone feel slightly better.

Except, they're not. It's a very common few simple words, if they've heard it they may not laugh again, they might not have even laughed the first time. It's not a magic spell you cast upon someone to make them enjoy themselves. How are these three words going to change anything in the grand scheme of things? Life is uncontrollable, sometimes things happen and you can't stop them, and life is unpredictable. You'll never see it coming, so the real question is is it better to try in case it works, or to not in case it backfires?

This, however, *is* controllable. I was lying when I said life was uncontrollable, and I was lying when I said it was unpredictable. Sure, you can't control everything all by yourself, but the amount of effort a human being can put into it, could just make a small change. These changes could create domino effects, and change the world entirely. If you have a plan, you can do it. So, what's your plan? Do you wanna hear the punchline, or would you rather scroll on with your day on the internet?

It's entirely up to you. You can stop reading if you want, or you can go on.

We can all go on.

Additionally, there are Swiss Army Knives which are very useful and are something you should always have included in your paraphernalia. Very portable, helpful, and can potentially protect you if someone's attempting to mug you for some strange reason.

One night, Ms. White is watching Wheel of Fortune on the TV.  It's getting late so she decides to turn in for the night.  She hears a knock on the door.

Ms. White say ""fine, first door on the right"".

Not wanting to go to sleep right away, Ms. White stays up a little longer just to check if anyone else would come along.  Sure enough, about ten minutes later, another knock on the door.  Looking out, she sees a purple minivan spewing out black smoke.  Mrs. Purple is at the door, and asks to stay the night, promising to call a tow truck in the morning.  ""Fine.

892,WARNING: 18+,1,0.57," 

I was sitting alone in my bedroom at my computer. It had been 12 days since my last shower and 6 days since I last slept. The only thing keeping me awake was the stench of my body odor being circulated around my room by the jet engine that was my RTX 3080 Founders Edition. But why was I keeping myself awake for so long? It was to write saucy pasta for [r/copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/). Any second I was asleep was time I was not writing pasta, and not making opportunities to get comments from my one true love, Cummy.

Before Cummy, I was a sexless husk. Even though I had been through puberty, no sexual desire ever overtook me. For the longest time I assumed I was asexual. I cried every night from the sadness of missing out on a human experience. During one of my sobbing sessions I came across the [r/copypasta](https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/) subreddit and decided to write a pasta about jelqing while I had a banana up my ass. As soon as I posted, I got an instant comment.

“Is my post already popular? Who would care about my work this much?” I thought to myself.

I checked the comment and that’s when I saw him for the first time, Cummy. He had written my pasta word for word, as is in spirit with copypastas. The fact that he had done this so quickly filled me with joy. Not only that, but there was another feeling, some kind of internal spark that I had never felt before. I wasn’t sure what it was but I knew that I wanted to feel it again. The only way to achieve that was to write more pasta.

Day after day I posted more and more pasta on the subreddit. Sounding, school shootings, Ben Shapiro, Fortnite fart porn, any topic I could think of. Anything that was worthy of another post. Each time, Cummy would reply within seconds and trigger the feeling. Not only that, but the feeling seemed to grow each time. Had I really discovered it? Was this… love?

And that’s how I ended up in my cycle of sleepless nights. I just wanted to see his username pop up on my screen for the small piece of human connection that was missing in my life. The pain was dulled by the ecstasy of my connection with Cummy. I thought this would last forever, but that would not be the happy ending to my love story.

I sat at my PC one morning with a fresh new pasta idea. The hosts of Masterchef Australia force feeding George spicy crab and then licking the sweat off his bald head. A bit out there, but I’m sure it would give Cummy a chuckle. I posted and waited. One second, two seconds, three. I started to shiver.

“Maybe Reddit’s servers are being a bit slow? I know their system admins spend most of their days snorting cocaine so the site sometimes keks itself.”

One minute. 5 minutes. An hour. Two hours. I went into full panic mode wondering where my love was. I browsed the front page of the sub to see if anyone knew where Cummy was. That’s when I saw the post. Cummy was dead.

I couldn’t read the rest of the post. I didn’t need to know the reason. All I knew was that my love was gone. I didn’t shout, I didn’t cry. I just stared blankly into the void. At that moment, my body seemed to take over. I stood up and walked out of my bedroom without my brain being involved. It felt like instinct was kicking in. I walked down the stairs and into the kitchen. I stood over my dog’s corpse who had died of starvation, walked through the pile of rat feces and went straight to the drawers. I opened the top drawer and pulled out the biggest knife in the pile. I held it against my neck and was ready to slash. I guess deep down, I knew this was the only way I’d see Cummy again. I closed my eyes and prepared myself for the brief pain. But that’s when I heard it.

“Not so fast!” I heard a voice shout. This confused me greatly. I didn’t live with anyone since my parents moved out and ran to Tahiti to get away from their disappointment of a son. I opened my eyes and looked in the direction of the voice. It took a moment for my eyes to adjust through the thin layer of tears. When my eyes focused, I saw before me a larger man dressed as the Flash. Although overweight, he somehow triggered a feeling of lust deep within me.

“I hear you’re a big fan” said the gentleman.

These words confused me, but only after a few seconds did I realise. Standing in front of me was my love, Cummy.

I dropped the knife and ran straight into his muscular arms.

“Cummy, I thought you were dead!” I cried, tears seeping into his suit.

He explained. “Haha! Many people did. But it was faked. I felt that I had to move on from Reddit.”

“Bu-... But why would you do such a thing? You scared us all!” I asked.

He leaned into my ear and whispered “To be with you, of course.”

These words shocked me to the bone. I never thought that I’d have love in my life. Not only that, but it also triggered something else completely new. I felt movement in my pants, a kind I had never experienced. I looked down and I saw it. I had gotten my first erection. Not only that, it was poking into Cummy’s thigh. He felt it against himself and looked down.

“Now look what we have here” he whispered lustfully. He placed his hand on my leg and stroked it upwards towards my groin.

“Is this really happening Cummy? It’s all so fast.” I said. I voiced concern, but this was mostly an act. I’d let Cummy do anything to me. He quickly grabbed me around my shaft.

“Oh yes it is.” he said.

This was the moment where it started. He didn’t stroke, he didn’t tease. Instead, he started to rotate me around him. While this took me by surprise, it was a greatly pleasurable experience. While I was trying to keep pace with the motion on my feet, the speed eventually increased too greatly for this. My feet came off the floor. I was being spun around by my cock in the air. Cummy started spinning even faster. Eventually, the movement of myself around him created a propeller-like updraft. This caused Cummy himself to start rising off the floor. We rose so high that we almost hit the ceiling.

“Are you ready for the finale?” he asked. I braced myself.

“Yes Cummy, do it.”

He performed one final spin with great force.

“SO LONG, GAY BOWSER!”

He released me from his hand and launched me at supersonic speeds. This caused me to release a jet engine force of cum out of my penis. Cummy crossed his arms in front of himself to block the shot, but the force still caused him to be pushed back along the floor.

I shot through the walls of all the rooms in my own house and the neighbouring houses. I went through multiple kitchens, bedrooms, bathrooms, each leaving a perfect silhouette hole in the wall. I eventually made my way through all the buildings and out into the open. My forceful jizz cannon caused me to fly sporadically in the air. I looked over and saw another person flying using cock-force. They seemed to be able to control their flight though. I pushed my erect penis downward and locked it between my legs. By holding my arms outward and moving my hips, I was able to now fly gracefully through the air. The other person flew towards me.

“Who let you release?” I asked.

“I had a run-in with Owoifier and… you can say he ‘took me for a spin’” he responded.

We both chuckled and continued to fly. We span around each other, creating beautiful jizz patterns in the air. Children ran to their windows to look at the beauty. Many made wishes upon us, assuming we were some magical force. However, all beauty must come to an end.

Myself and my new friend started to feel the pressure from our penises dim and putter.

“I guess we’re about out” I said.

“Yes” he responded. “Looks like this is about to come to a close.”

We turned upwards and held each other in our arms. We flew in front of the moon as the last of our fuel diminished. We started to fall. We had no plans for a soft landing, our lives were complete.

The police found our bodies the next day. We were piled on each other in the middle of the road, covered in blood and man butter. A sheet was pulled over our bodies. A crowd had gathered to see what had happened. At the back of the crowd however, stood Cummy. He saw that his work was done. He ran off at his supersonic speed to complete his next lover’s life.",3,False,False,4

Confused, his dad agrees, and on his fifteenth birthday, the son opens his present to find a single pig pong ball inside. 

“Dad! Thank you so much! I am the happiest kid on this planet!”

The next day, the father goes into his son’s room but doesn’t find the ping pong ball anywhere.

His son says, “Dad, I have everything I could ever want. But there is one thing that would make me the happiest person alive.”

The father, only wanting to please his son, asks what that one thing is.

The father was a little weirded out, but he did as his son wished, and on his sixteenth birthday, the son opened his present to find a pack of ping pong balls. 

“Dad thank you so much! I love them!”

The next day, he goes up to his son’s room, and doesn’t find one ping pong ball anywhere. 

Twelve months pass, and it’s time for the son to turn seventeen. 

The father, ready for whatever outrageous gift his son might want, asks him what he would like for his birthday. 

His son says, “Dad, I have everything I could ever want. But there is one thing that would make me the happiest person alive.”

The dad, thinking he’s about to spend a shitload of money on a new car, asks his son what that thing is. 

“I want a jug of ping pong balls.”

The dad, who was just taken aback by the whole situation, bought his son a jug of ping pong balls to open on his seventeenth birthday. 

“Oh my god! Dad thank you so much!”

On the next day, the dad goes into his son’s room, but doesn’t find a single ping pong ball anywhere. 

Four seasons pass, and his son is becoming an adult. The father, who is about to send his only son to college, prepares himself for the amount of money he is about to spend on his favorite kid to send him to his alma mater, and asks him what he wants for his birthday. 

His son says, “Dad, I have everything I could ever want. But there is one thing that would make me the happiest person alive.”

The father asks him what that one thing just might be. 

“Well dad, I want a warehouse full of ping pong balls.”

The dad is like, holy shit? “What is up with my son and his ping pong balls?” But he does as his son wishes, and the next day, he drives his son to the an old abandoned warehouse. They open the door, and ping pong balls just roll out. Everywhere. 

“Dad. Thank you so much. I love you!”

Around 24 hours later, the dad drives down to the warehouse, opens the door, but there’s not a single ping pong ball inside. 

8,772 hours later, the son is turning nineteen. But a few days before his birthday, he is in an awful wreck. He’s hospitalized. Hooked up to thirty different machines. 

The father is devastated. He goes into his son’s hospital room, and asks him what he wants for his birthday. “Son, I’m going to make this your best birthday yet. I will buy you anything. Anything you want.”

His son says, “Dad, I have everything I could ever want. But there is one thing that would make me the happiest person alive.”

The dad, who is already up to protocol, is like, “alright. How many ping pong balls do you want this time?”

“I want a boatload. As many as you can buy.”

The father, just trying to make his son’s days in the hospital enjoyable, buys a boatload of ping pong balls. He buys out every warehouse of ping pong balls. Uses his life savings to buy every single ping pong ball in America. 

He walks into his son’s hospital room to tell him the news. 

“Dad I can’t believe you bought me all of these ping pong balls. How can I ever repay you?”

The dad, who wants to know what the fuck is up with his son and these ping pong balls, asks, “well there is one way son.”

“What is it Dad?”

“What do you do with all of these fucking ping pong balls?”

The son was happy to tell his dad what he did with the ping pong balls. “Well dad,” he started, but never finished. The son died.

26,"A priest, a rabbi, and an atheist walk into a bar...",3361,0.98,"The bartender sees this, and thinks to himself “huh, this seems like the setup to a joke”. 

Then he thinks about it more.

“That seems oddly specific for all these people to be hanging out together at the same time, and for it to be a common joke. Maybe they planned it?”

The bartender recalls on his life, his wonderful wife and beautiful kids. How he loves them.

The bartender, irked, walks outside for a breath a fresh air. Something seems off to him. 

He looks to the sky, and ponders “what looks odd about today?” 

Theres something here that he cannot place his finger on it.

“The sky. Yes, the sky. Somethings off with the sky.”

The bartender asks a passerby about it, and they look at him like he’s crazy.

“What the fuck is it about that sky today?”


Then it hits him.


It isn’t real.



“What the fuck?!” He asks himself, distressed. “Is this all just a dream? I’ve lived for 43 years on this Earth and its all just a dream!?” 

But the bartender was wrong. He then realized this.

“Wait... the priest... the rabbi... and the atheist! This is all a joke! My life is the setup to a joke! How much time is left? Am I even 43? Does-does my family even exist? My life? My hardships? My loves? My friendships? All just for a fucking joke? What sick god created this world for me? Fuck that god!”

The bartender then stopped talking. He waited for the release of death, or the world to stop. He stood in the street, on his knees looking up to the faux sky, waiting.

65,What's worse than finding a worm in an apple?,2456,0.97,"Finding half your family has been brutally murdered, and you could have stopped it since you have been training in martial arts since you were a kid but unfortunately you were somewhere else at the time. 

You feel horrible guilt for the rest of your life and consider suicide. You buy a gun, but the truth is you're too much of a coward to pull the trigger anyway. You fall into drugs and alcohol, spiraling from one empty relationship to the next, until all that's left of you is a few trophies and a sad, empty shell of a man. 

You keep photographs of the family members you lost in your wallet, but you take them out and burn them one by one. They can't help you now. 

You're beyond help, just as they had been that fateful day. 

The remaining members of your family are not doing much better. Your father is wracked with guilt just as you are; he takes his own life driving the wrong way on the highway. He kills a young couple in the process. 

Your kid sister Claire falls off the map entirely, and no one is ever really sure what happened to her. You hope she's doing well, but you know better.

Your grandmother... your poor, poor grandmother. She was 80 years old that day when her daughter, husband, and twin grandsons were murdered. You stop by the nursing home sometimes and make small-talk, but you can see in her eyes that all you do is remind her of what she's lost.

You swipe some of her medication and dump half the bottle down your throat like it's a fucking ice cream shake. You wash it down with some trash liquor you bought the night before. You close your eyes as the pain starts in your stomach. This is finally it. You'll finally find peace, on your own terms.

Just as the sweet relief of death begins to steal you away from your miserable existence, your phone rings. It's Claire. *She's alive!* You answer, and you immediately start retching. She calls 911 and saves your life. 

She visits you in the hospital and you notice cuts on her arm. She hasn't been doing much better than you, as you suspected. But she's glad you're alive. You wish you could feel the same way.

You begin to resent Claire for saving you. *You were so close, dammit!* But over the next few years you begin to notice something else. Claire checks in with you from time to time and she seems... better. At your grandmother's funeral, neither of you cry... no, tears don't mean much these days. But you see a ring. She's married now? 

One day you find out you have cancer, and it's a late diagnosis. You don't have much time left. Sitting in Claire's living room with her husband a few weeks before the end, she reveals she's pregnant. You realize in that moment that in a way, *you* saved *her*. When she intervened in your suicide attempt all those years earlier, it gave her something she hadn't had in a long time. Something you still didn't have. 

*Hope*.

Now it's your turn for a funeral. Cancer finished what you couldn't, and you're buried next to the rest of your family. Claire is the only one left. This time, she cries. As her husband puts his arm around her, she instinctively holds her round belly. 

Your family has been through hell, but somehow your sister survived everything. And now, with luck, it's time to start over.",108,True,False,4

72,A woman is caught speeding,2390,0.98,"A woman is caught speeding.

When the oficer asks for her license, she explains that she lost it for drunk driving.

Concerned, the officer asks her for the vehicles registration, but she explains that she stole the car, murdered the owner, and stuffed his corpse in the trunk.

The officer asks her to wait for a moment and gets back in his car. he calls for backup and explains the situation to them. When his backup arrives, they investigate the trunk. There's no body. The responding officer asks for her license and registration, and she happily hands it over. The responding officer is very confuse at this point, and tells the women ""My partner here says that you stole this car and murdered the owner.""

She only laughs. ""I bet that liar told you that I was speeding too.""

Unfortunately the first officer's body camera was running and the woman is arrested and charged with obstruction of justice and false reporting to a police officer. She is convicted and sentenced to three months of jail time with the possibility of early release pending good behaviour.

On the inside she is introduced the methamphetamines and quickly develops an addiction. She is released after serving a month, but the hooks of addiction already run deep. She quickly finds herself mingling with the wrong crowds, selling her possessions for one more dose. At the age for thirty she's a mother to three, strung out and begging for money to support herself and her children. The stresses for their destitute life will impact them all differently.

Brenden, the eldest, will fall into drugs like his mother. Once in prison he will embrace a criminal lifestyle and spend the rest of his days revolving in and out of prison. He will die young of an overdose, surrounded by other users, but no friends. But that is then, this is now.

Ellaine, the middle child, will live a material life, ever bouncing between jobs to try to afford her next big want, and relying heavily on the support of her family and friends in her numerous unemployed periods. She internalizes her anger and frustration, and spends her life burning bridges when she lashes out at others. She doesn't know why she's always angry but never manages to stop. She dies in her middle age, after mixing her sleeping pills with a gin and tonic. But that is then, this is now.

The youngest child. Simon. He breaks free of the vicious cycle that consumes his family. He leads a moderatly succesful life, working for a large corporation. But he never feels free. Free from his family. Free from his life. Free from his stress.

While driving home one day, his cell phone rings. Maybe it's his sister, asking for another month's rent. Maybe it's the police, asking for bail for his brother yet again. But he can't handle answering the phone, so he accelerates. Speeding up to 70, to 80 miles per hour. The dark lonely highway begins to blur as tears fill his eyes. 

He is only brought back to reality by lights and sirens behind him. He pulls over and the police officer walks up to his door.

""Sir, why were you speeding?"" The officer asks.

Simon sighs. ""I just can't deal with my family at the moment.""

The officer looks in the distance. He thinks of his wife, likely on her second bottle of wine by now. He thinks of his daughter, who keeps sneaking out later and later.

123,What is a pirate's least favorite letter?,2018,0.96,"[Please help me find the answer here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1F8WsUJGvMfNsFiGwnO0YYBUjew7HhwRVxxZ-i0QN-Gw/)

**Edit 1:** Thanks for your responses! I'm analyzing the result based on the first 1800 answers, but I'll still accept more answers and do another analysis later.

**Edit 2:** 1110 out of 1800 responses were done by pirates, which is about 62%. And there is an intense battle going on between Q and R; Q got 295 votes from pirates and R got 297 votes, so R is winning by just 2 votes! There are only 6 letters that got less than 200 votes: L with 190, M with 193, N with 197, O with 195, S with 191, and T with 195. It's interesting that almost all of them are adjacent.

Some pirates might not like non-alphabet characters, so there was the ""other"" option. Here are a few examples of voted letters:

* &

* Numbers like 2, 7, etc.

* Greek letters like Ξ, ξ, Ω, etc.

* Currency symbols like £, €, $, etc.

* Ñ, Å, Ö, etc.

* Æ

* 🐙

* Dear Sir/Madam, we are writing to inform you that you are in violation of the DMCA...

* Love letters

* Why are you doing this

* I lied, I am not a pirate

* The star wars movies

* Your mum

Don't be disappointed if you're not a pirate though, I'll also analyze non-pirates' responses next time!

TL;DR: Q and R are the strong candidates for a pirate's least favorite letter, and R is winning.

**Edit 3:** About 3800 responses! It's a lot more than I expected. I'll do the second analysis in a few hours.

**Edit 4:** 2417 responses out of 3824 were done by pirates, which is about 63%. Q got 690 votes from pirates and R got 607 votes, so Q is winning by 83 votes now! Next to R is Z, which got 561 votes. The most friendly letter is L, with only 418 votes.

People have pointed out that R being second is strange since pirates say ""Arrrrrr"" all the time, which sounds similar to R. Ironically, many pirates have said that R was the only letter that they didn't like. But other pirates have said that they didn't like any letter except R, so I guess that depends on how they treat the letter.

How about non-pirates? Q won by a large margin, getting 341 votes. The next is going to be either X or Z, with 223 and 226 votes respectively. Unlike for pirates, R is just a normal letter with 149 votes. Most friendly letters are M and T, with 91 and 90 votes respectively.

So when someone asks ""what is a pirate's least favorite letter?"" then we could say: ""It's Q."" I'll do the third analysis when things are settled down, with a complete graph showing how many votes each alphabet got.

TL;DR: It's Q.

**Edit 5:** Very slighty edited the above update.

**Edit 6:** It's been more than 2 months now, and I noticed that I still get about 20 responses each day. I'd like to thank you everyone for spreading pirates' and non-pirates' favor in letters to the world. I'll someday do the third analysis later. Also, I'm thinking of linking the spreadsheet of entire responses before this gets archived; should I do that?

270,An infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar...,1620,0.97,"At first, the bartender suspects nothing. It's just a few customers he will have to attend to.

What a mistake he made.

As more and more mathematicians walk into the bar, the place gets crowded VERY quickly. The other customers inside the bar starts getting uneasy, as the influx of mathematicians is blocking the exit to the bar and shows no signs of stopping.

Before you could even say ""I don't like where this is going"", the bar is fully crowded; not a single patch of floor is uncovered by feet, and yet the mathematicians are still piling in. The customers begin shouting, and the bartender is standing on his stool, attempting to keep the peace. Still, he too is panicking. What on earth is happening?!

Soon, the mathematicians begin stuffing themselves into the bar for real. They climb on top of one another, and although the small suburban bar isn't fit for occupying such a large group, The mathematician flow continues strongly. The walls begin creaking. The customers are screaming, then suffocating. The bartender manages to call 911 before he is crushed under the weight of the incoming mathematicians, along with the other customers.

Soon, with almost hundreds of witnesses observing the swelling bar, including a cluster of armed forces, the bar finally bursts. Mathematicians of all ages and sizes begin flooding out of the bar, and it seems to continuously grow each second at a monstrous rate. The riot shields are no match for the horde of mathematicians, and everyone watching attempts to flee, but get trampled. In no time, the entire town is filled with mathematicians and corpses of civilians. Then the entire country. Then the entire world.

The year is 2568. Nothing remained of our old society from 55 decades ago. All we have now are wastelands of mathematician corpses, and as bizarre as it seems, humanity continues to survive. A few government farms are scattered all across the globe to provide rations for all families; wheat farms on top of mathematician intestine pits growing bread for the hungry millions. Those who are unlucky have to resort to eating the rotting flesh of these dead mathematicians. Makeshift houses are formed using their bones, but are taken quickly by the monthly mathematician-floods. I hear that bar all the way back in Kansas is still producing fresh batches of 'em, so nobody worries about scarcity. In this anarchy-filled world, we have only 1 global rule: 

Kill **all** mathematicians in sight. None shall be spared.

It booms “You have finally freed me after all these years, so I’ll grant each one of you 3 wishes.” The first guy immediately blurts out “I want a billion dollars.” POOF, he’s holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50.

The second man thinks for a bit, then says “I want to be the richest man alive.” POOF, he’s holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion.

The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says “I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life. POOF, his arm starts rotating.

The Genie tells them it’s time for their second wish.

First guy says: “I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth.” POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm.

Second guy says ""l’lI want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want.” POOF, his looks change and the first guy’s wife immediately starts flirting with him.

Third guy says “I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die.” POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.
The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish.

First guy does, and after a while says “I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die.” POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don’t bother him any more.

Second guy says “I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever.” POOF, he looks younger already.

Third guy smiles triumphantly and says “My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth.” POOF, he’s now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around.

The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.

Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: “I’ve invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I’ve never gotten so much as a cold in all these years.” Second guy smiles and says “Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I’m still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven’t aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed.”

I'm sorry. Was that racist?""

The guy says, ""Since Muslims aren't a race, that wasn't racist. But that was you stereotyping, which in most circumstances wouldn't have been cool, but I've had a really long day and I couldn't give a damn. Can you pour me a beer please?""

The bartender says, ""Forgive me, but isn't drinking prohibited in your religion?""

The guy says, ""Well, yes, but I thought we were in America.""

The bartender says, ""You're right. You're right. You can drink here. But I'm just wondering, like, I don't know much about that culture and that lifestyle. Will you feel guilty after drinking this beer?""

The guy says, ""I've drank beer plenty of times. You see, I'm what you might call a moderate Muslim. I'm not perfect. I've had premarital relationships with a couple of girls. I've eaten the odd pork pie every now and then. And on weekends I drink. I'm a Muslim, but I'm also very much a citizen of the Western world, where these things are okay. Does that answer your question?""

The bartender says, ""So I do not have to feel guilty about pouring you this here beer?""

The guy smiles. ""About as guilty as you'd feel for pouring the same drink to a Jewish person, a Christian, or a Hindu.""

The bartender smiles back and hands him the glass. The guy takes a sip and smacks his lips.

""Thank you for this. I've had a really long day. There's this MERN stack app that I've been developing, and it's been really taxing. I haven't slept in more than eighteen hours.""

""So where are you from?"" The bartender asks.

""North Carolina,"" the guy says.

""No, I meant, like, where are you really from? Like where did your family come from?""

The guy frowns a bit and takes another sip from his glass and puts it down on the bar. ""Now that I mind. Why would you think we came from anywhere?""

""Oh, I'm sorry. Please, I didn't mean anything by it. It's just that I was wondering where your family immigrated from,"" the bartender says. His face is a bit flushed.

""That's all right. Okay, so I was born here. In North Carolina. Born and raised in Raleigh. My dad moved here from Pakistan. He's a systems engineer. My mom's from India. She'd come here for her Master's. Does that answer your question?""

""Pretty much. So you're an American,"" the bartender says.

""As much as you are,"" the guy says and raises his glass.

""I'll drink to that,"" the bartender says and clinks his shot glass with the guy's.

Later when the guy takes out his wallet from his pocket to pay, the bartender shakes his head and says, ""It's on the house. And listen, my friend, I'm a democrat. I would have voted for Obama a third time. And I'm not Islamophobic or xenophobic at all. You're welcome here anytime.""

The guy smiles and shakes the bartender's hand and says, ""Only if you let me pay for the drinks from now on. I'm not one to trigger your white guilt for free drinks.""

""This is dialogue. We need more dialogue like this to heal our country, to bring people together. You know?"" the bartender says.

448,Why is 6 afraid of 7?,1393,0.97,"It's a fairly common question, mostly because when people see 6 and 7 next to each other, it doesn't really make sense. 6 is large, muscled, and trained in multiple martial arts, while 7 is fairly average, physically, and short.

However, 6's fear of 7 has its roots in childhood. See, 6 and 7 grew up together, and for a few years, they were best friends. But then 6 kissed 3, and they become childhood sweethearts. But 7 secretly had feelings for 3, so 7 decided he needed to destroy 6 to win 3's affection.

He started subtly, undermining 6 whenever possible with passive aggressive comments, and compli-sults. But over time, things got much more insidious. 7 started messing with 6's performance in school, bringing down his grades and turning teachers against him. Even worse, 7 became great friends with 6's parents and slowly turned them against their own offspring.

At night, 7 would sneak into 6's bedroom, and whisper depressing and hopeless things into his ears. And every time 3 was around, 7 would pants 6 and make fun of his genitalia, or try to body shame him in other ways.

However, 3 was both smart and compassionate, and saw through 7's schemes, and stuck with 6, trying to counter 7's phycological tear-down with compliments, and friendship. Finally, 7 decided that he would never be able to win 3, so he drugged both 6 and 3, and took them to an abandoned cobbler's hut on the edge of town.

There, he proceeded to torture and maim 3, forcing 6 to watch in horror, unable to do anything to save his sweetheart. 7 didn't kill 3, but instead, put her in a semi-vegetative state. 7 cleaned the scene of his presence, then called the cops, and 6 was blamed for 3's condition.

6 was sent to prison, and because they believed 6 was guilty, 6's parents fell into a deep depression, eventually committing suicide over what they believed 6 had done.

After serving 17 years of a 30-year sentence, and getting out on good behavior, 6, now muscled and skilled as a fighter, thought he might get revenge on 7. But when he finally tracked 7 down, he found out that 7 had installed a micro-bomb into 3's body, and should he be killed, the bomb would automatically go off and kill 3 as well.

And though she was still in a mostly fugue state, 6 couldn't bring himself to hurt her any further, and decided to try and move on with his life.

Sorry to keep you waiting; complicated business; complicated.

Thank you very much.

I’ve just received a call from Secretary Clinton.

She congratulated us — it’s about us — on our victory, and I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she — she fought very hard.

Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country.

I mean that very sincerely.

Now it’s time for America to bind the wounds of division; have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as one united people.

It’s time. I pledge to every citizen of our land that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me.

For those who have chosen not to support me in the past, of which there were a few people. . .

. . . I’m reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country.

As I’ve said from the beginning, ours was not a campaign, but rather an incredible and great movement made up of millions of hard-working men and women who love their country and want a better, brighter future for themselves and for their families.

It’s a movement comprised of Americans from all races, religions, backgrounds and beliefs who want and expect our government to serve the people, and serve the people it will.

Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. I’ve spent my entire life and business looking at the untapped potential in projects and in people all over the world. That is now what I want to do for our country.

Tremendous potential. I’ve gotten to know our country so well — tremendous potential. It’s going to be a beautiful thing. Every single American will have the opportunity to realize his or her fullest potential. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer.

We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.

We will also finally take care of our great veterans.

They’ve been so loyal, and I’ve gotten to know so many over this 18-month journey. The time I’ve spent with them during this campaign has been among my greatest honors. Our veterans are incredible people. We will embark upon a project of national growth and renewal. I will harness the creative talents of our people and we will call upon the best and brightest to leverage their tremendous talent for the benefit of all. It’s going to happen.

We have a great economic plan. We will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world. At the same time, we will get along with all other nations willing to get along with us. We will be.

We’ll have great relationships. We expect to have great, great relationships. No dream is too big, no challenge is too great.

Nothing we want for our future is beyond our reach.

America will no longer settle for anything less than the best.

We must reclaim our country’s destiny and dream big and bold and daring. We have to do that. We’re going to dream of things for our country and beautiful things and successful things once again.

I want to tell the world community that while we will always put America’s interests first, we will deal fairly with everyone, with everyone — all people and all other nations. We will seek common ground, not hostility; partnership, not conflict.

And now I’d like to take this moment to thank some of the people who really helped me with this, what they are calling tonight, very, very historic victory.

First, I want to thank my parents, who I know are looking down on me right now.
Great people. I’ve learned so much from them. They were wonderful in every regard. I had truly great parents.

I also want to thank my sisters, Maryanne and Elizabeth, who are here with us tonight. And, where are they? They’re here someplace. They’re very shy, actually. And my brother Robert — my great friend. Where is Robert? Where is Robert?

My brother Robert. And they should all be on this stage, but that’s OK. They’re great. And also my late brother, Fred. Great guy. Fantastic guy.

Fantastic family. I was very lucky. Great brothers, sisters; great, unbelievable parents.

To Melania and Don. . .

. . . and Ivanka. . .

. . . and Eric and Tiffany and Baron, I love you and I thank you, and especially for putting up with all of those hours. This was tough.

This was tough. This political stuff is nasty and it’s tough. So I want to thank my family very much. Really fantastic. Thank you all. Thank you all.

And Lara, unbelievable job, unbelievable.

Vanessa, thank you. Thank you very much.

What a great group. You’ve all given me such incredible support, and I will tell you that we have a large group of people. You know, they kept saying we have a small staff. Not so small. Look at all the people that we have. Look at all of these people.

And Kellyanne and Chris and Rudy and Steve and David. We have got — we have got tremendously talented people up here. And I want to tell you, it’s been — it’s been very, very special. I want to give a very special thanks to our former mayor, Rudy Giuliani.

Unbelievable. Unbelievable. He traveled with us and he went through meetings. That Rudy never changes. Where’s Rudy? Where is he? Rudy.

Governor Chris Christie, folks, was unbelievable.

Thank you, Chris.

The first man, first senator, first major, major politician, and let me tell you, he is highly respected in Washington because he’s as smart as you get: Senator Jeff Sessions. Where is Jeff?

Great man.

Another great man, very tough competitor. He was not easy. He was not easy. Who is that? Is that the mayor that showed up?

Is that Rudy? Oh, Rudy got up here.

Another great man who has been really a friend to me. But I’ll tell you, I got to know him as a competitor because he was one of the folks that was negotiating to go against those Democrats: Dr. Ben Carson. Where is Ben?

Where is Ben?

And by the way, Mike Huckabee is here someplace, and he is fantastic. Mike and his family, Sarah — thank you very much.

General Mike Flynn. Where is Mike?

And General Kellogg. We have over 200 generals and admirals that have endorsed our campaign. And they’re special people and it’s really an honor. We have 22 congressional Medal of Honor recipients. We have just tremendous people.

A very special person who believed me and, you know, I’d read reports that I wasn’t getting along with him. I never had a bad second with him. He’s an unbelievable star. He is. . .

That’s right. How did you possibly guess? So let me tell you about Reince, and I’ve said this. I said, Reince — and I know it, I know. Look at all those people over there. I know it. Reince is a superstar. But I said, “They can’t call you a superstar, Reince, unless we win,” because you can’t be called a superstar — like Secretariat — if Secretariat came in second, Secretariat would not have that big, beautiful bronze bust at the track at Belmont.

But I’ll tell you, Reince is really a star. And he is the hardest-working guy. And in a certain way, I did this — Reince, come up here. Where is Reince? Get over here, Reince.

Boy oh boy oh boy. It’s about time you did this, Reince. My God.

Say a few words. No, come on, say something.

Thank you. It’s been an honor. God bless. Thank God.

Amazing guy.

Our partnership with the RNC was so important to the success and what we’ve done.

So I also have to say I’ve gotten to know some incredible people — the Secret Service people.

They’re tough and they’re smart and they’re sharp, and I don’t want to mess around with them, I can tell you. And when I want to go and wave to a big group of people and they rip me down and put me back down on the seat. But they are fantastic people, so I want to thank the Secret Service.

And law enforcement in New York City. They’re here tonight.

These are spectacular people, sometimes underappreciated unfortunately, but we appreciate them. We know what they go through.

So, it’s been what they call a historic event, but to be really historic, we have to do a great job. And I promise you that I will not let you down. We will do a great job. We will do a great job.

I look very much forward to being your president, and hopefully at the end of two years or three years or four years, or maybe even eight years. . .

. . . you will say, so many of you worked so hard for us, but you will say that — you will say that that was something that you really were very proud to do and I can. . .

Thank you very much.

And I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is now really just beginning.

We’re going to get to work immediately for the American people. And we’re going to be doing a job that hopefully you will be so proud of your president. You’ll be so proud. Again, it’s my honor. It was an amazing evening. It’s been an amazing two-year period. And I love this country.

Thank you. Thank you very much.

507,How many persons does it take to change a light bulb?,1317,0.98,"Well, that depends.  

Is the lightbulb reachable without much effort? Then most likely one person is enough, unless the switch is in a different far-off room, in which case, it is much more efficient if there is another person to assist the first by switching off the light before changing it.  

In certain cases, where the lightbulb is out of one's reach, one may need a variety of tools to be able to reach said bulb. This may include, but are not limited too, stepladders, normal ladders, cranes, and lifts.  

Stepladders are typically the most used option for many cases, as they are almost in every home, building or establishment. Although one person can operate the stepladder and change the lightbulb, it is a general consensus that there should at least be one person to stabilize the stepladder. This assistance, however, have not been proven to actually be of any help as most stepladders have rubber grips that prevent slipping and the triangular shape of the stepladder is already stable enough as it is (although the writer has admitted that it may be weak against forces that act on it perpendicular to it's direction, i.e. to the open side).

Normal ladders, like stepladders, are also commonly used but it doesn't provide the same safety as a stepladder, but does provide a longer reach than most of it's stepladder counterparts. Recent normal ladders can extend up to 10 to 15 meters, which may prove to be effective on changing lightbulbs that are far from the ground level (although the difficult placement of the lightbulb is subject to inquiry). However, ladders can be quite dangerous and is only usable when there's a stable and strong wall to hold it up, something a stepladder doesn't need. Like the stepladder, one person will suffice but another one to assists is more than welcome.

Cranes and lifts are amongst the best in height and safety category. Although most models need someone to operate them separetly from the person changing the lightbulb, there are some that allows the person that will go up to control the crane/lift. The biggest disadvantage of these equipment is their unwieldy size and cost of acquisition and maintenance, which may turn off almost all consumers.  

  

Special lightbulbs are also essential to the question. Would one person be enough to change all the burnt out light bulbs of a billboard sign? They can, but it would be horribly inefficient. Although, technically, one person would be changing one lightbulb, the group of people that person is a part of have a singular purpose in mind and in this case is to replace all defective lightbulbs.  

  
  
There are a lot of other ways that can influence the answer to the question, it is not limited to what I have enumerated. As such, this one implores the reader to be open-minded and curious.

520,"Two scientists walk in a bar. The first one says ""I'd like some H2O"".",1310,0.9,"The second scientist hesitated for a moment. He knew he was not naturally witty and his research partner often stole the spotlight, but he realized it was his time to shine. In a flash, he remembered the classic joke that would take place in this very similar situation. He pictured it immediately :

""And I'd like some H2O too !"" he would say, proud of himself, possibly getting a few genuine laughs from the people around the bar, maybe even for this cute girl he saw in the corner of his eye when he entered.

But he didn't. Instead, he considered the odds of failing, and the consequences. To him, failing meant looking stupid to everyone around, even though, for a very long time, he was looking for someone to tell him how funny he thought he was. What he just wanted was to be validated, maybe even appreciated by some. I mean, a man can dream, right ?

Seemingly lost in his thoughts, the second scientist eventually came to realize that an excruciatingly long time of four seconds had passed since his colleague placed his order. This realization from the second scientist hit him even harder when he saw the part-time bartender, looking at him in the eyes. ""What am I even doing ?"" he thought to himself.

It was time to act, at last. Time, however, was against him. 5 seconds had passed now. Is it too late to go back and still make this joke ? I mean, it could be still be funny. Oh god, but what if it's not, and he makes even more a fool of himself by wasting everyone's time just to reference that shitty joke he heard once ?

Yes, shitty. That's how he was describing the joke now. The second scientist had now started to make excuses. He knew, but at the same time, didn't want to admit that he was pathetic, so he blamed it on the joke, which was shitty now, apparently. What did this joke even do to him ? Potentially making him look like a moron, that's what.

Six seconds. There was no turning back. The second scientist could not bear the pressure any longer. But somehow, he did, as his order was still not coming up. It was like he forgot how to breathe. By the second, he was feeling more and more uncomfortable. A distracted eye was now looking at the girl in the bar. She looked disgusted at him, because he was stupid and unfunny. Well, actually, she was just looking over the bar with a neutral expression and without thinking about anything in particular, but what the second scientist thought she was thinking made more sense, considering how much of a pathetic guy he is.

Eventually, the concern reached his colleague, who directed a ""Hmm ?"" towards the second scientist, in an attempt to free him from the despair that was eating him alive. At that moment, he snapped, but only partially. With all the little amount of mental strength he has, he tried to rely on his human instincts to find a solution to his issue. 

""Uuhhh"" he managed to say, still facing the bartender. YES ! Now that is a step forward. Feeling proud of the way he managed to reset his awkward silence timer, the second scientist was now at least 10% at peace, and resumed thinking about his order.

But this time, even if he managed to take the joke out of his head, a feeling of crippling anxiety came to knock at his brain's door for his hourly visit. In the second that followed, he analysed all the shit he just went through. The scenario he made in his head. The fact that no one likes him because he's a disgusting loser. The fact that everyone was waiting for him to answer, but he couldn't. What the hell was even wrong with him, honestly ?

Focus. Focus on your order. End this for good, right now. That's what he told himself. So he focused. But he realized that he did not know what drink he even wanted in the first place. After a short session of telling himself how much he sucked for the 142nd time of the day, he took the initiative and gave himself the objective of always thinking of his order before entering a bar. Little did he know, he would realize 2 days later that he did not enforce this new rule at all, which would trigger his 89th session of telling himself how much he sucked for that day.

In a halo of holy light, literal savior sent by the gods, a person stepped up and gave him a helping hand. But that person was not a saint, he was simply the part-time bartender, who was thinking that he doesn't get paid enough to deal with weird customers like the second scientist. 

""Do you want some water too, sir ?""

The problem was cut down to a much simple one : answering the question. It was pretty much the same thing as the initial situation, but he did feel relieved. He also realized that the bartender knew immediately what H2O means. But then again, everyone knows what H2O means, right ? No. NO. STOP THINKING ABOUT THIS GOD DAMN JOKE. It was not the time for indecision.

He saw the light at the end of the tunnel. Like a merciful blessing, he finally knew how to answer. He felt it. The words were making their way out of his lungs, modulated by his vocal chords. At long last, he was to put an end to his misery. He did not even really know what he was about to say, but did he care ? No, he did not. In a couple of milliseconds, he was about to be free. There was no way he could feel the crippling depression that has been devouring him for years ever again. And then, with a slight hint of pride, he said :

The bull starts browsing the assortment of China ware and crockery. The owner follows the bull around while trying to appear inconspicuous and pretends to be busy with rearranging some of the wares on display.

The bull eventually notices the owner peeking at him and asks: ""Excuse me, is there a problem here?"" The owner replies with an accent: ""I know how your kind behave! Do your business quick and go."" The bull, with a shocked facial expression replies: ""Whoah, whoah! What is /that/ supposed to mean?!""

The owner says: ""If it walk like duck, quack like duck, it probably is duck!"" The bull becomes indignant and says in a shaky voice: ""What!? Are you equating me to an animal?! You want to see some animalistic behaviour right now, bigot?!"" The owner rebutes: ""You shitting me?! You literally are animal!"" The bull becomes enraged at the owner's last remark and starts trashing the store, shattering numerous wares.

The owner yells: ""Stop! Get out! I call police! See?! If it walk like duck, quac...""

""Shut the FUCK UP! Shut up, bigot!"" The bull yells, cutting the owner off before continuing to trash the store even more vigorously.

Rodman Erwin Sterling, the narrator of The Twilight Zone comes into the store, saying: ""And thus the idiom 'Like a bull in a China shop', manifests at the inconvenience of the store owner, like an inevitable outcome, a self-fulfilling prophecy that was ironically instigated by the owner himsel-.""

""You! Stop standing there and talk like idiot! Call police, now! This serious!"" The owner yells at Rodman while trying to save some of his wares. The bull impales Rodman with his horns in a rage induced bloodlust and hurls him into the air. ""aNd tHuS tHe IdIoM 'LIkE a BUlL iN a cHinAsHoP' wueh wueh wueeh!"" The bull mockingly says before impaling and killing the shop owner as well.

The bull was sentenced to 25 years in prison, receiving some leniency after accepting a plea deal. That bull quickly asserted his dominance in the high risk penitentiary by killing one of the toughest men there and became the shot caller for the entire population of inmates.

The bull gained notoriety under the name ""El Toro Loco"" and would be a dominant menace in more prisons due to transfers. El Toro Loco was eventually shanked by a dozen inmates simultaneously in the shower, successfully toppling his reign after 8 years.",32,True,False,4

Besides the reading factor alone however, there is a substantive amount to contrast between each individual, and much to meditate on. These differences extend beyond merely career, education, upbringing, etc and broach upon the very Weltanschauung of these men. If you operate heavy machinery, you may find yourself distracted when pondering said differences somewhat extensively, and this could be diverting enough to actually put you in danger if your mind begins to wander at work. Please for your own safety, leave this thread until you get home. It's an absorbing topic, but your wellbeing is of higher priority. 

A basic cursory outlook at the mini bios of these two immediately presents us with 187 distinct differences, however, these may be simply ""cosmetic"" so to speak, and appear as the same differences that either individual would have with any other person. I believe upon further investigation and inquiry, many more will become apparent. 

From Armstrong's Wikipedia:

For other people named Neil Armstrong, see Neil Armstrong (disambiguation).
Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut, engineer, and the first person to walk on the Moon. He was also an aerospace engineer, naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor. Before becoming an astronaut, Armstrong was an officer in the U.S. Navy and served in the Korean War. After the war, he earned his bachelor's degree at Purdue University and served as a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station, where he logged over 900 flights. He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California.

A participant in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs, Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1962. He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, with pilot David Scott. This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster, in the first in-flight space emergency.

Armstrong's second and last spaceflight was as commander of Apollo 11, the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969. Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin descended to the lunar surface and spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. President Jimmy Carter presented Armstrong the Congressional Space Medal of Honor in 1978. Armstrong and his former crewmates received the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.

Armstrong died in Cincinnati, Ohio on August 25, 2012, at the age of 82, after complications from coronary artery bypass surgery.

Armstrong was born on August 5, 1930 near Wapakoneta, Ohio, the son of Stephen Koenig Armstrong and Viola Louise Engel. He was of German, Irish, and Scottish ancestry, and had a younger sister, June, and a younger brother, Dean. His father worked as an auditor for the Ohio state government; the family moved around the state repeatedly after Armstrong's birth, living in 20 towns. Armstrong's love for flying grew during this time, having gotten off to an early start when his father took his two-year-old son to the Cleveland Air Races. When he was five, he experienced his first airplane flight in Warren, Ohio on July 20, 1936 when he and his father took a ride in a Ford Trimotor, also known as the ""Tin Goose"".

His father's last move was in 1944, back to Wapakoneta. Armstrong attended Blume High School and took flying lessons at the grassy Wapakoneta airfield. He earned a student flight certificate on his 16th birthday, then soloed later in August; all before he had a driver's license.Armstrong was active in the Boy Scouts and earned the rank of Eagle Scout. As an adult, he was recognized by the Boy Scouts of America with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award. On July 18, 1969, while flying toward the Moon inside the Columbia, Armstrong greeted the Scouts: ""I'd like to say hello to all my fellow Scouts and Scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week; and Apollo 11 would like to send them best wishes"". Houston replied: ""Thank you, Apollo 11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news. Certainly appreciate that."" Among the very few personal items that Neil Armstrong carried with him to the Moon and back was a World Scout Badge.

In 1947, at age 17, Armstrong began studying aeronautical engineering at Purdue University. He was the second person in his family to attend college. He was also accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The only engineer he knew (who had attended MIT) dissuaded him from attending, telling Armstrong that it was not necessary to go all the way to Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a good education.

His college tuition was paid for under the Holloway Plan. Successful applicants committed to two years of study, followed by two years of flight training and one year of service in the U.S. Navy as an aviator, then completion of the final two years of their bachelor's degree. Candidates had to promise to not marry until graduation, signed the ""Aviation Guarantee"" to serve on Active Duty for at least four years, and would not receive a promotion to Ensign until two years after they received their Midshipman's warrant.

From Jackson's Wikipedia:

""The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson He began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those of ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Thriller"" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped bring the television channel MTV to fame. Jackson's 1987 album Bad spawned the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"", ""Bad"", ""The Way You Make Me Feel"", ""Man in the Mirror"", and ""Dirty Diana"", becoming the first album to have five number-one singles in the nation. He continued to innovate with videos such as ""Black or White"" and ""Scream"" throughout the 1990s, and forged a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various music genres.

Thriller is the best-selling album of all time, with estimated sales of 65 million copies worldwide. Jackson's other albums, including Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling albums. He is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, and was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Dance Hall of Fame as the only dancer from pop and rock music. His other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records including the Most Successful Entertainer of All Time,13 Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend Award, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, 26 American Music Awards—more than any other artist—including the ""Artist of the Century"" and ""Artist of the 1980s"", 13 number-one singles in the United States during his solo career—more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era—and estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide.""Jackson won hundreds of awards, making him the most awarded recording artist in the history of popular music.He became the first artist in history to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades when ""Love Never Felt So Good"" reached number nine on May 21, 2014.Jackson traveled the world attending events honoring his humanitarianism, and, in 2000, the Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer.

Aspects of Jackson's personal life, including his changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In 1993, he was accused of child sexual abuse, but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series, This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief, and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world. Forbes ranks Jackson the top-earning dead celebrity, with earnings of $825 million in 2016, the highest yearly amount ever recorded by the publication.Jackson is also remembered for his generous philanthropy and his pioneering efforts in charitable fundraising within the entertainment industry.

Edit:  Ok, I'm back.  The art of serial killing itself is what causes him exhaustion, which is primarily the cause of his procrastination in all other aspects of life.  Anyone who thinks his work is easy can fk off and rot with the rest of the pigs in eternal damnation.  They should try walking in his shoes for once.  The planning, sharpening, stalking, binding, killing, dismembering, digging, turning around and driving all the way back home to make sure he locked the shed, scripture memorization, writing letters in code to the police and press, ect... it takes all the energy he has.  And when his nagging, controlling, publically humiliating b*tch of a wife commands him to mow the lawn, stain the deck and wash her feet, he promises to do it all on Sunday.  Sunday is his designated ""no serial killing day""... and the day he uses to catch up on aspects of life other than his work.  Plus there's this, of course...

But today was 6’s first day of middle school. She wanted to be more open-minded than her parents, more tolerating than her community. *No matter what, they’re numbers like me*, she thought. 

7 was the only multi-syllabled number in 6’s class. 6 smiled at her, even if no one else did. *Don’t be afraid*, she planned to say. *I’ll be your friend.*

Sure enough, 7 eased up as the day went by. No one scowled at her, or whispered behind her back. As she walked into the cafeteria, 6 was flushed with relief as she saw how welcoming everyone else was.

803,Why was six afraid of seven?,1060,0.97,"""July 12th, 1997,"" said Johnny Alverro. ""That's a day I'll never forget."" 

The court room was deathly silent, all in attendance eager to learn the truth about Johnny ""Six"" Alverro and the most notorious incident to ever occur at the Fibonacci Correctional Facility.  The accused, Sven Müller, stared unerringly at Alverro, oozing hatred and malice. 

""You see,"" continued Johnny, ""the Aryans are structured. Pricks, the whole lot of 'em, but they run a tight ship. And the captain of that ship was George Fischer. His brotherhood name was ""Nein"". Reason being, he had no mercy. Got a guy on the floor, begging for his life, literally crying and pissin' himself, George would just say ""nein"" and stomp the bastards skull in.

""Second in command is, or was, that sick fuck over there,"" said Johnny, pointing vehemently at Sven. ""Sven Müller. Brotherhood name: ""Seven"". Same number of life sentences he's got under his belt. For now.

""Anyways, the day in question started out normal. That was until we got to the showers. I was just minding my own business, doing my thing, when I see most of the guys leave. That's when I knew shit was going down. I got the soap out of my eyes and tried to get my shit together, but it was too late. I hid in the shower stall best I could. Didn't wanna get caught in any crossfire, y'know? I heard Sven and George arguing about a drug shipment that went missing. Meth is big in Fibonacci. Guys'll do anything for a hit. Anyways, George is accusing Sven of hoarding it all for himself. Everyone knew Sven was a junkie, but nobody said nothing. Except George. And only once. Sven got pissed and started swinging. George fought back as hard as he could. Shit was fast and brutal. George went down. I knew he was done for. Sven must've been high on some nasty shit, because he didn't just kill George. He...he...""

The courtroom sat in anticipation, everyone on the edge of their seats. Everyone except for Sven and Johnny. Sven sat coldly in his seat, staring white hot daggers at Johnny. Johnny squirmed and rocked madly in his chair, feeling Sven's glare, feeling fear. Johnny had always been afraid of Sven, but never like this. 

""Please Mr. Alverro,"" said the judge. ""Tell us what happened next.""

Johnny tried to compose himself, but couldn't get ahold of himself. He started crying tears of panic and terror. Through his wretched sobs, he told the courtroom the conclusion of the shower brawl. 

""Sven shoved a shiv right into George's chest. George tried to fight back, but it was too late. George died within seconds. I thought it was over. But Sven started cutting away at George's chest.

However, for the purpose of this question let's focus on [this article](http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/ss/slideshow-teeth-wreckers) from webmd.com, though it must be noted that one should not consider a web ""listicle"" as a definitive source. This is merely presented as a jumping-off point for discussion.

That being said, based on the aforementioned article, the following items could be red and bad for your teeth:

* Ice cubes that have been dyed red
* Bedtime bottles that are red in color
* Tongue piercings where the metal or plastic is red in color
* Red cough drops
* Red gummy candy
* Red soda (interestingly, the site notes that artificial sweeteners may have an acidic effect, so are not free of repurcussions regarding effects on one's teeth)
* Anything with red packaging that you attempt to open with your teeth
* Red sports drinks
* Red fruit juice
* Red potato chips
* Frequently snacking on red food
* Chewing on red pencils
* Red cigarettes (there are certain clove varieties that have a reddish color. One could say ""Marlboro Reds"", but that could be considered a joke and inappropriate for this subreddit)
* Red Wine
* Binge eating red food

A couple of final notes... The list includes items that are not just *things*, but *things+actions*. Though the latter may not be considered truly in the spirit of the question, they are included to help a more complete discussion. Also, though the site mentions tongue piercings, it should be noted that labret (or other oral) piercings may also have a negative effect on tooth/gum health.

The man says: “I can’t believe this is happening!  This is awesome!  I want one million trillion dollars!”

“As you wish,” the genie says, and vanishes.

Moments later, the payload is delivered, fatally crushing the man, his home, the entire city in which he lived, and most of the neighboring towns...instantly.  Tens of thousands were dead.  On the outskirts of the enormous stacks of dollar bills, survivors filled suitcases full of money despite the best efforts of state and county police to control the situation.  People from all over the country (and in fact, the world) flocked to the least-controlled areas of the outskirts, filling trucks and cars with hard cash.  Eventually the National Guard was called in and a state of emergency was declared.  The President signed an executive order declaring the bills in the deadly stack to be valueless and would not be recognized by the Federal Reserve or Congress as official United States Dollars.  

Even with that order, however, it became incredibly difficult to enforce.  The bills were by all accounts genuine with individual serial numbers, as if they had been created at the Bureau of Engraving.  Records showed that the serial numbers didn’t match anything that had been physically produced by the bureau, but despite the best efforts of the finest forensic scientists available, a counterfeit marker could not be firmly acquired.  Controlling the flow of this money into the economy was simply impossible.  

Eventually the government tried to collect the bills using heavy loading equipment where it would be delivered to a local trash-to-steam facility and be burned.  This proved cumbersome and slow-moving at best, and when Tropical Storm Victor took an untimely pass over the heart of the stacks, bills were said to be scattered hundreds of miles from the original crash site.  

With the large influx of what some postulated to be hundreds of billions of dollars into the hands of everyday citizens, the United States dollar began to collapse in global markets, making the Yen the most powerful currency in the world.  Inflation skyrocketed and several countries with US dollars as their reserve currency declared bankruptcy.  

After a ten-year global recession, eventually the world markets regained normalcy and the global banking system was back on track, but not without a joint effort of the world's largest banking corporations banding together to adjust other currencies to match the unprecedented and unexplained influx of United States dollars into the system.

""Well, for $15 I can give you 'ol Bill. He's seen a few years but he's still a fast horse"" replies the owner.

""Why so cheap then?""

""Well, he ain't so good at listening. You see, he gets his Whoas and Giddy-ups mixed-up.""

""You're kidding? Well, I don't have much choice. Here's $15, friend.""

After he'd payed for the horse the owner went out to the stable to get Bill. When he came back, the cowboy could see that Bill was indeed old, but had very strong legs. After preparing the saddle, the cowboy hopped on Bill.

""Alright, Bill. Giddy-up!""

Bill would not move, not a twitch from his ears.

""C'mon Bill! Giddy-up!"" he clicked, kicking the horse with his spurs.

Bill wouldn't budge. Not a swish from his tail. Remembering what the owner had said, the cowboy adjusted his reins and called...

""Whoa, Bill!""

Bill's ears perked, and he flew out of the barn like a bat out of hell. Horse and rider were outside the town in seconds, with a huge dust cloud trailing behind them. Off they went, flying over the Arizona hills. The cowboy could barely hold on to his reins; his feet flailing out behind the stirrups.

Over the next hill the cowboy could see that Bill was running them straight towards the edge of the Grand Canyon. He pulled back on the reins.

""Whoa, Bill! Whoa!"" he cried.

Bill kept running. The edge of the precipice coming closer.

""Whoa, Bill! Stop, damn it!""

He suddenly recalled what the owner had said about Bill's mixed-up directions. Taking a deep breath the cowboy closed his eyes and shouted ""Giddy-up, Bill!""

Bill came to an abruptly fast stop, just one horse-step away from certain death. The cowboy nearly vaulted over Bill into the vast gorge. Bill panted with exhaustion while the cowboy wiped his brow with his kerchief. From atop Bill, he looked down into the canyon at the dry riverbed far below.

""Whoa, Bill. That was close""

Fortunately, Bill was a horse and knew better than to run off a cliff, and so the cowboy's ill-considered use of the word woah in this context had no negative repercussions.",24,False,False,4

Reddit, as a community, stands for free speech and I cant believe that some chucklefuck new mod really thought it would be acceptable to make the bot remove every fucking comment in a sub literally called ""darkjokes"". There needs to be a rule preventing children from becoming moderators.

Mods should not be trying to limit speech. We’ve seen that around here a lot of lately from people on mod teams. That’s what progressives do, complete cuck sjw moves. We can tell the mods responsible for automoderator are not  free speech warriors, that’s for sure.

I believe in 100% liberty, freedom and the individual can do what you want. I know like maybe two guys who do this, and more power to them, nevertheless I’ll advise nobody to do this. The attack on masculinity, traditionalism and man is insane in our cultural marxist culture. This is some bullshit I would see in a Laci Green or Reily J Denis cringe You Tube video.

Everybody is a victim these days and so offended by EVERYTHING. Get off the internet if you can’t handle a comment on a public platform on the internet.

Welcome to the assault on free speech in 2017.

#From now on, you can comment whatever you like. 

Ive done my best to take corrective action against the mods who did this, but this is just further evidence that the reddit moderator procurement system is like the political structure of a corrupt sub saharan African Banana republic.

There's no system whatsoever to deal with a corrupt moderator, so therefore it's like trying to balance a pencil on its tip. The slightest bit of corruption that worms itself in will breed more corruption. Imagine how it feels if law enforcement was like this, they just bust into your house and smash up your stuff and vanish, and then you complain and try to escalate to police the police, everyone treats you like you're a criminal and you are ruthlessly silenced and excluded from speaking to anyone else about it.

The question reddit has to ask itself is: ""How do corrupt Banana republics reform their police forces to eliminate corruption?"" If we're honest, the question is neither intuitive nor easy to implement. I don't envy the founders and employees of Reddit now, there is some difficult decisions and turbulant seas ahead, since now even the state and federal government is starting to create laws that restrict the rights of websites (because of sites like reddit) to police up the behavior of it's power users in accordance to state and federal laws, so that websites don't become breeding grounds for evil organizations like ISIS or foreign powers who stand in defiance of American sovereignty.

158,An apology to the r/DarkJokes community.,6283,0.92,"For starters, don't tell any of the other mods about this.  They're all powermods, and really don't pay any attention to the sub unless they get a modmail or are actively messing with something.

They've been abusing this subreddit for way too long, so I felt that something needed to be done.

I ""infiltrated"" the mod list a month ago under the guise that I could help keep the userbase from rioting too much to keep the sub from getting banned by the admins, but still enough so that it would remain funny to the people messing with the sub.

As you can see most recently, they had the automoderator locking threads, comments, and posting homoerotic copypastas.  They claim that this was done by userbase vote, but they weighted the vote so that the outcome was pre-determined.  

---

I have adjusted the automoderator config so that the power now rests with the userbase.  I think this might be a good trial run for elimination of moderators altogether, so let's make it work.

I created a list of commands that will automatically cause a moderation function to occur.  As a user, you now have the following commands at your disposal:

* !lock  - This will lock the thread (probably won't need this one, but it is a mod feature. The best use here is to protect a thread from an outside brigade)

* !flair [text] - This will set the flair of the thread.  Example:  !flair [good joke] will set the flair to say [good joke]

* !repeat [text] - This will let you make automoderator make a comment of your choosing.  IDK we can do it, so you should be able to as well.  Example:  !repeat [suck a dick, nerd] will make automod say [suck a dick nerd] (I couldn't figure out how to make it work without the brackets)

* !setmode reports on - This will set a mode which will remove any comment which gets reported.  This is necessary in case someone makes a comment that breaks TOS.

* !setmode reports off - This will turn off reports mode.  Obviously you don't want to cause every single comment that gets reported to get removed all the time.

*  !remove - this will remove the post.  Helps prevent spam.

* !sticky1 - This will place the thread into the #1 sticky spot.

* !sticky2 - This will place the thread into the #2 sticky spot.

* !oc - This will set the OC tag.  

* !notoc - Sometimes people set the OC tag on reposts.  This will let you turn it off.

* !spoiler - This will set the spoiler tag, in case someone posts a joke about Endgame or some other movie, and forgets to do it themselves.

* !notspoiler - This will remove the spoiler tag.  Sometimes people try to set the spoiler tag to hide a punchline or otherwise cheat karma.

* !sort new - This will change the selected sort to ""new"".  Displays the newest comment first.

* !sort top - This will change the selected sort to ""top"".   Displays the most upvoted comment first.

* !contest - This will turn on contest mode.

* !contest off - This will turn off contest mode.

---

That's it for now.  If I forgot any commands, I'll add them later.  I didn't add a ban function, because no one should be banned from this subreddit anyway.

366,Got a good one for you all,0,0.3,"Q: A man walked into a bar and looked down at his phone.  On his Lock Screen was a hot dog in a bun.  The man paused, looking over the hot dog one more time and sighed, putting his phone back into his pocket.
He came here to drink his problems away.  To drink away his divorce, missing his sons high school graduation, a performance review that went poorly.  He thought about buying as much alcohol as he could and just going home to drink it all and wither away.  
“No one would know”, he thought to himself.  
“I have the power to control my life and what happens to it.  I could call it right here, right now, and all I would to do is keep pressing these aluminum cans to my lips.  It’d be so effortless and I can’t help but feel, attracted to the idea”
After a quick trip to the store, he returned home with numerous cases of beer.
He opened the first can and took a sip.  Right as he was about to take another, there was a knock at the door.
“Colby..?  Are you in there?  I need to talk to you!”
Colby hesitated for a moment, wondering if he would answer the door.  After a moment of thinking, he concluded that he should at least say goodbye to someone.  He set the can down near all of the other alcohol and walked to the door.
As Colby opened the door, it took him by surprise who it was; Mark, one of his closest childhood friends.
“Hey man, I had something I wanted to talk to you about.  Care if I come in for a bit?
Colby, still taken by surprise from Mark’s presence told him to come in, forgetting about the many cases of beer sitting out in the open.
Mark walked in and sat down on the couch and right as he was about to ask him something, he noticed the cases of beer.  Mark’s train of thought came crashing down for a moment as he puzzled about why Colby would have so much alcohol.
“Hey Colby, what’s up with all of the beer?”
The second Mark asked, Colby started stuttering, scrambling for a possible explanation.
But he couldn’t think of one.  He looked up at Mark, trying to think of a way to go about saying goodbye to his friend...
But Mark, without saying a word tightly embraced him.  Whatever Mark came to ask him didn’t matter to him now, as he could see that Colby needed him right then.
They hugged tightly for a few minutes, tears stains forming on their shoulders.
“Colby, I don’t know what you’ve been going through lately, nor do I believe that I might be able to truly understand how you feel either.  But you are my closest friend, and I can’t bear the thought of losing you.  You don’t have to tell me what’s been going on right now, hell you don’t have to tell me anything if you don’t want to, but I want to be here for you however I can be, okay?”
As Mark shakily uttered these words to Colby, something beyond simple words started taking place inside of Colby.  He had fixated so much on everything that was going poorly in his life that he had forgotten to take a second to think about the things that were good in his life; the people he’s close to.  In that moment, he could feel Mark’s pain at the idea of losing him, and in a strange way it helped him clear his head a little.
As a fog slowly lifted from Colby’s mind, he started to tell Mark the things that were upsetting him.  Telling him how he couldn’t see a way forward and how he felt that no one would have known that he had passed, had he drunk all of the alcohol.
Mark offered to take him on a drive to clear his head a little and to help him get his feelings out more.
As they drove, Colby smiled for the first time in what felt like months.  He looked up at the sky, and a thought bounded through his mind.
“I think I’m going to be okay.  All these things happening to me are temporary.  I’ll find someone to remarry to.  I’ll apologize to my son for not being able to make it, maybe take him somewhere to celebrate one on one.  I’ll start applying myself more at work.  It’s gonna be hard but-“
“Colby, are you okay?”
Colby broke from his seemingly-therapeutic trance and looked over at Mark.
“.....Honestly, no...  but I will be.”

291,Got a good one for you all,0,0.4,"Q: A man walked into a bar and looked down at his phone.  On his Lock Screen was a hot dog in a bun.  The man paused, looking over the hot dog one more time and sighed, putting his phone back into his pocket.
He came here to drink his problems away.  To drink away his divorce, missing his sons high school graduation, a performance review that went poorly.  He thought about buying as much alcohol as he could and just going home to drink it all and wither away.  
“No one would know”, he thought to himself.  
“I have the power to control my life and what happens to it.  I could call it right here, right now, and all I would to do is keep pressing these aluminum cans to my lips.  It’d be so effortless and I can’t help but feel, attracted to the idea”
After a quick trip to the store, he returned home with numerous cases of beer.
He opened the first can and took a sip.  Right as he was about to take another, there was a knock at the door.
“Colby..?  Are you in there?  I need to talk to you!”
Colby hesitated for a moment, wondering if he would answer the door.  After a moment of thinking, he concluded that he should at least say goodbye to someone.  He set the can down near all of the other alcohol and walked to the door.
As Colby opened the door, it took him by surprise who it was; Mark, one of his closest childhood friends.
“Hey man, I had something I wanted to talk to you about.  Care if I come in for a bit?
Colby, still taken by surprise from Mark’s presence told him to come in, forgetting about the many cases of beer sitting out in the open.
Mark walked in and sat down on the couch and right as he was about to ask him something, he noticed the cases of beer.  Mark’s train of thought came crashing down for a moment as he puzzled about why Colby would have so much alcohol.
“Hey Colby, what’s up with all of the beer?”
The second Mark asked, Colby started stuttering, scrambling for a possible explanation.
But he couldn’t think of one.  He looked up at Mark, trying to think of a way to go about saying goodbye to his friend...
But Mark, without saying a word tightly embraced him.  Whatever Mark came to ask him didn’t matter to him now, as he could see that Colby needed him right then.
They hugged tightly for a few minutes, tears stains forming on their shoulders.
“Colby, I don’t know what you’ve been going through lately, nor do I believe that I might be able to truly understand how you feel either.  But you are my closest friend, and I can’t bear the thought of losing you.  You don’t have to tell me what’s been going on right now, hell you don’t have to tell me anything if you don’t want to, but I want to be here for you however I can be, okay?”
As Mark shakily uttered these words to Colby, something beyond simple words started taking place inside of Colby.  He had fixated so much on everything that was going poorly in his life that he had forgotten to take a second to think about the things that were good in his life; the people he’s close to.  In that moment, he could feel Mark’s pain at the idea of losing him, and in a strange way it helped him clear his head a little.
As a fog slowly lifted from Colby’s mind, he started to tell Mark the things that were upsetting him.  Telling him how he couldn’t see a way forward and how he felt that no one would have known that he had passed, had he drunk all of the alcohol.
Mark offered to take him on a drive to clear his head a little and to help him get his feelings out more.
As they drove, Colby smiled for the first time in what felt like months.  He looked up at the sky, and a thought bounded through his mind.
“I think I’m going to be okay.  All these things happening to me are temporary.  I’ll find someone to remarry to.  I’ll apologize to my son for not being able to make it, maybe take him somewhere to celebrate one on one.  I’ll start applying myself more at work.  It’s gonna be hard but-“
“Colby, are you okay?”
Colby broke from his seemingly-therapeutic trance and looked over at Mark.
“.....Honestly, no...  but I will be.”

So, she walks over and takes a seat next to him on the bench, turns to him and says, ""Sorry to bother you. I know this may be a little forward but I would love to grab coffee with you some time."" 

Flattered, the man responds, ""Sure... but what makes you so certain you and I would get along so well?""

""Well..."" the woman says. ""A couple things, actually. I noticed you were wearing an Iron Maiden t-shirt. Iron Maiden are my favorite band of all time. When they went on their reunion tour in 1999, my parents took me to see them in Cleveland. I was 12 years old and it was the first concert I ever went to. I absolutely love Iron Maiden.""

The man can't believe it. 

""I saw them play Cleveland in '99! First concert I ever went to on my own. My best friend Jimmy Spitz and I told our parents we were sleeping at each others' houses, snuck out, took a bus into the city and saw them play at the Plain Dealer Pavillion!"" 

Naturally, they're both shocked.

""If that isn't weird enough..."" says the woman. ""I noticed you're reading Mark Twain. I was a communications major in university and I actually wrote my thesis on Mark Twain and how he used satire as a lens to comment on current events of the time, comparing him to satirical news sources of today. He's my favorite author.""

Now the man is really taken aback, ""Get out of here! I was an English major in university! I specialized in 19th century American literature and this is like my fourth or fifth time reading Tom Sawyer, I absolutely love Mark Twain.""

They both can't believe it...this has got to be a match made in heaven.

""Ok..."" the woman says. ""Well, buckle up because here's the icing on the cake. I noticed you're eating a prune. Prunes are my absolute favorite fruit. When I was a kid, my grandfather lived on a farm. He had an orchard that mainly grew apples and some lemons, but he knew how much my sister and I loved prunes so he kept a couple of plum trees. Every year at the end of the summer, we'd go up and harvest the plums with him. He'd dry them and by the time we'd go back to his place for Thanksgiving he'd always have those prunes saved just for us. They're my favorite fruit! I love prunes, you're eating a prune, this has got to be fate. What do you say?""

471,"Three boys go into a haunted house. One brought a knife, one brought a gun and one brought some cough drops",12236,0.95,"They crept in. It was pitch black and stone quiet. They were suddenly starting to regret this dare. Stupidly, only one brought a flash light. The aggressive darkness and inky black yielded with grudging compliance but always seeming to push back. They moved cautiously onward amid the dust and cobwebs. The floor creaked. They breathed in tight, quick breaths. You could hear a pin drop.

Suddenly, there was a deep moan. ""OOOOOOOOUUUUU"". It seemed from below them. The house had been abandoned for years. Who *or what* could make such a sound? The boys looked at each other, but continued on, hearts pounding in their chests.

As they proceeded into the kitchen they encountered a swarm of flies. Buzzing and beating their necks and faces, they rushed and stumbled to the door, not stopping to see what they were truly feasting on. They slammed the door behind them. Maybe a body? But no way were they going back to find out. And again came the sound, ""ooooOOOOOooooOOUUU"" but louder this time, and closer.

They proceeded through the dark into the dining room. They saw a fully set dining table covered in cob webs. Dust-covered regal-looking glasses, goblets and silverware adorned the table. Spiders climbed on ivory plates. Clearly a house of privilege and set for a grand feast which never happened. 

Or, perhaps, met a fatal end?

They pushed on. But again that unearthly howl. 

""oooooOOOOOOOOOOOUuuuuUUUUuuUUOOOOooo"". 

They found the basement staircase, and from below, the sounds seemed to be emanating. Could they proceed? Would they? Did they dare? Two of the boys looked at each other, faces filled with worry. 

But the third said, confidently, ""We're going down there."" Not wanting to seem the weaker, the other two boys steeled themselves and nodded.

The stairs creaked and groaned evily under their feet. The rickety banister shook in angry defiance. Insects and vermin scattered underneath them with every step. They were descending into hell, they knew, but none would turn back.

And the sound: ""oOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUuuuuUUOOOO"". Now loud enough to fill not only their heads but seeming to claw at their very souls! 

Now at the basement door! The antique, crying squeak of the hinges eeeeeeEEEEEEEEEEee made the boys wince and almost cover their ears. But they had to know. WHAT is making that horrible, terrible sound?

**""ooooooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUoooooUUUUUUUOOOOOOO""**

In the center of the basement lay an unholy coffin! A twisted artistic expression of murder, decay and disease! Brutish, incorrect lengths had been forced together, buckling the wood and bulging the steel at points, as if death, itself, were attempting to escape. It was festooned with beast-like emblems and decrepid artifacts: skulls, antlers, skins, totems, and drenched in the color of blood!

It was TRUE! The house really *was* haunted!

**""OOOoooOOOoOOooOoOouuUUUUUuuuuUOOuouOUO""**

Now the boys realized with sheer horror that the insane moaning was definitely coming from the coffin! 

Before the boys could turn and run, the coffin began to shake! They froze. 

Then it suddenly LIFTED off the ground! They gaped in terror! 

Shaking violently and rising, the coffin started to turn. It turned and turned, and gained speed. It was spinning in the air before them! A mix of terror and fascination gripped them. Unable to look away. Unable to run. It spun faster and faster AND FASTER!

**""OOOoooOOOoOOooOoOouuUUUUUuuuuUOOuouOUOOOOOOOoo""**

The first boy with the knife slashed in the air in front of him, as if to stab away at the evil! Then he dropped the knife and ran back up the stairs, never to be seen again.

The second boy with the gun fired warning shots at the ceiling BANG! BANG!, but then thought better of it, dropped his gun and also ran up the stairs, and also was never to be seen again.

The third boy stood there calmly, reached into his pocket and popped a cough drop into his mouth. He sucked on it for a bit.

And the coffin stopped.

730,The ultimate Dad Joke - Bulgarian Train Man,10499,0.96,"This has been my favourite joke for at least a couple years now.

A man drives train in Bulgaria. One day, he falls asleep driving, and runs over someone walking on the tracks. Well, his case goes to court, and he gets the death sentence for murder. So, he's on death row and the executioner approaches him.

""What would you like for your last meal?""

""I would like a banana please.""

The executioner thinks it's weird, but shrugs and gives him a banana. The guy eats his banana, waits awhile, and gets strapped into the electric chair. When the flip the switch, nothing happens! In Bulgaria, an act of divine intervention means you get released.

A few months go by, and the train driver has been working for a new company. Well, old habits die hard, and he falls asleep again, killing 2 people this time. The court has no patience for recklessness, so he ends up on death row again. After awhile, the same executioner from last time approaches him.

""You again? Shit. What do you want this time?""

""Two bananas please.""

The executioner shrugs and hands him two bananas. A bit weird, but whatever. There's no way he can cheat death twice! But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again. The train driver walks a second time.

Some time passes, and the executioner is very busy. After another few months, the same dude shows up, apparently having run over 3 people with a train. Exacberated, the executioner approaches him for the third time.

""Let me guess. Three bananas?""

""Actually yes! How did you know?""

""Top bad! This has gone on long enough. No more bananas! Today you fry.""

So, the train driver gets strapped into the chair with no last meal. But, when they flip the switch, nothing happens again.

""I dont get it,"" says the executioner. ""I didnt let you eat any bananas!""

""Its not the bananas. *I'm a bad conductor.*""

Racism, Misogyny, bigotry, and the like is not welcome on 3amjokes. Users who defend it or present it in any format will be banned for varying lengths of time. between 30 and 600 days. If this does not describe your sense of humor or the things you have submitted, you don't have to read anything beyond this point.

The rules for this sub state:

> Follow Reddit's rules  - This includes reddiquette and all sitewide rules that can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/rules/).

Within those rules you will see:

> Rule 1

> Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. **Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.**

There's a host of dark or offensive jokes you will easily find if you look for them. Give those a shot before promoting hate in a subreddit for... jokes meant for the sleep deprived.

**r/3amjokes will not be a platform for hate.**

The #1 defense i saw in the modmail was, (these are real quotes)

_""Oh my god dude its a shallow joke, are we still a child?""_

_""God forbid someone makes a joke in the comment section of a joke sub! ""_

New: _"" it's just satire!""_

I'd like to take a second to say that saying something _""is just a joke""_ is not a valid defense of being a shithead.  _""It's just a joke""_ is what children say to test boundaries, to see what they can get away with. It's what legitimate racists say while reading the room after letting their true personalities show. Instead of owning up to your own ideals.

Here's a long-ass write up on the subject
https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/mama-phd/just-joking-defense

Further, Allowing one joke like that to seep through the cracks is a bright shining beacon for the people who actually honestly believe those things. When the original users go ""lol it was just a joke"" and mean it, the people who really actually like those things and believe in them see it as a bright flashing sign that the community will accept them. (most) people absolutely love for their ideals to be reflected back at them, to be accepted as part of a group. 

If you're reading this and it's too much for you by all means, unsubscribe from the subreddit. If you're offended by my desire to keep the sub friendly and reject that stupid bullshit... really, actually, legitimately: Leave.

Users who (are in the minority but god damn are they loud) think it'd be funny to continue this trend will find themselves banned. this is your warning (that several people complained about not getting).

The sidebar rules have been updated to specifically state the above... which disgusts me.

He was crawling forward when  he heard a light pitter patter. In his confusion, forgetting that he wasn't supposed to be there he blurted out ""Captain, are you urinating?""

I’ll feed the baby and I’ll call a repairman I know who’ll be at your house to fix the washing machine promptly. Now stop crying. I’ll do everything. In fact, I’ll even call Jim at the office and tell him he ought to come home and help out for once.”

Racism, Misogyny, bigotry, and the like is not welcome on 3amjokes. Users who defend it or present it in any format will be banned for varying lengths of time. between 30 and 600 days. If this does not describe your sense of humor or the things you have submitted, you don't have to read anything beyond this point.

The rules for this sub state:

> Follow Reddit's rules  - This includes reddiquette and all sitewide rules that can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/rules/).

Within those rules you will see:

> Rule 1

> Remember the human. Reddit is a place for creating community and belonging, not for attacking marginalized or vulnerable groups of people. Everyone has a right to use Reddit free of harassment, bullying, and threats of violence. **Communities and users that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.**

There's a host of dark or offensive jokes you will easily find if you look for them. Give those a shot before promoting hate in a subreddit for... jokes meant for the sleep deprived.

**r/3amjokes will not be a platform for hate.**

The #1 defense i saw in the modmail was, (these are real quotes)

_""Oh my god dude its a shallow joke, are we still a child?""_

_""God forbid someone makes a joke in the comment section of a joke sub! ""_

New: _"" it's just satire!""_

I'd like to take a second to say that saying something _""is just a joke""_ is not a valid defense of being a shithead.  _""It's just a joke""_ is what children say to test boundaries, to see what they can get away with. It's what legitimate racists say while reading the room after letting their true personalities show. Instead of owning up to your own ideals.

Here's a long-ass write up on the subject
https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/mama-phd/just-joking-defense

Further, Allowing one joke like that to seep through the cracks is a bright shining beacon for the people who actually honestly believe those things. When the original users go ""lol it was just a joke"" and mean it, the people who really actually like those things and believe in them see it as a bright flashing sign that the community will accept them. (most) people absolutely love for their ideals to be reflected back at them, to be accepted as part of a group. 

If you're reading this and it's too much for you by all means, unsubscribe from the subreddit. If you're offended by my desire to keep the sub friendly and reject that stupid bullshit... really, actually, legitimately: Leave.

Users who (are in the minority but god damn are they loud) think it'd be funny to continue this trend will find themselves banned. this is your warning (that several people complained about not getting).

The sidebar rules have been updated to specifically state the above... which disgusts me.

 The captain followed the path, for a few minutes but suddenly, at a big stone, deviated from it. Edwin could feel the anticipation rise. He was so close to finally solving the mystery. He followed slowly behind and found himself in a clearing. The first thing he noticed was a large gravestone. The writing on it had been completely eroded and he could not make out any words. Wondering if this was someone the captain paid respects too, he tried to inch closer to get a better look. He could make out the captain's silhouette, facing away from him, into the brush. He was crawling forward when  he heard a light pitter patter. In his confusion, forgetting that he wasn't supposed to be there he blurted out ""Captain, are you urinating?""

It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you.

I had to elope with my new girlfriend, because I wanted to avoid a scene with mom and you.

I've been finding real passion with Stacy.

She is so nice, but I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes and because she is so much older than I am.

But it's not only the passion, dad.

She's pregnant.

Stacy said that we will be very happy.

She owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter.

We share a dream of having many more children.

Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.

We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.

In the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for AIDS so that Stacy can get better.

She sure deserves it!

Don't worry dad, I'm 15, and I know how to take care of myself.

Someday, I'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

Love, your son, Joshua.

P.S. Dad, none of the above is true.

I'm over at Jason's house.

I just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table.

The warden saw that deep down, Andy was a good person and made arrangements for Andy to learn a trade while doing his time.
